China showed off a new military drone and a model of a next-generation fighter plane yesterday.Industry giant China Aviation Industry Corporation displayed its Yi Long drone, or Wing Loong in English, at the airshow in Zhuhai.AVIC, which makes both military and civil aircraft, also showed a model of a new generation fighter jet, the J-31, a stealth plane whose existence was made known only recently.AVIC had shown only a model of the 9-meter drone, which can carry two missiles, at previous airshows.The drone resembles the Predator used by the US military and manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, but it is likely to be much cheaper at around US$1 million.The People's Daily website said AVIC also displayed a fourth-generation fighter, which it identified as the J-31, a stealth plane that had its first test flight last month.But an AVIC official was quoted as saying that the model was a "concept" plane still under development.China's first stealth fighter, the J-20 unveiled early last year, is not expected to enter service until 2018.
