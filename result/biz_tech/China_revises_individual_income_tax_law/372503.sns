China's tax burden is bigger than that of other countries with upper-middle incomes, according to a risk research report of China's taxation released by the Central University of Finance and Economics on Sunday, the newspaper Economic reported today.According to the report, there was an imbalance between China's macro tax burden and the supply of public service.An industry expert told the newspaper the severity of the tax burden should be linked to government spending on peoples' livelihood.The report indicates the government's unreasonable fiscal expenditure structure led to the disproportion between welfare and tax, the newspaper said."Determining a reasonable tax burden level is the primary solution to China's macro tax burden", the news report said.
