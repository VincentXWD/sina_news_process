Carlos Slim remained the world’s richest person for a second year with estimated assets of $74 billion, according to Forbes magazine’s annual global ranking of billionaires. The net worth of Mexico’s Slim, 71, whose holdings include the largest mobile phone operator in the Americas, rose $20.5 billion. Bill Gates, 55, chairman of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), was second again as his net worth rose $3 billion to $56 billion. Warren Buffett, 80, chief executive officer of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), held on to third place with $50 billion. There were a record number of billionaires in 2011, with 1,210 in total, compared with the previous high of 1,125 in 2008. Of the 214 newcomers this year, 54 were from China and 31 from Russia. The Asia-Pacific region had more billionaires than Europe for the first time in more than 10 years and gained the most billionaires of any region, with 105 newcomers. Moscow displaced New York as the city with the greatest number of billionaires with 79, compared with New York’s 58. “The big global story is not the individuals so much as what’s happening with the so-called BRICs,” referring to Brazil, Russia, India and China, “and the Asia-Pacific region,” said Forbes Media Editor-in-Chief Steve Forbes, in a press conference announcing the results yesterday. Slim’s net worth jumped more than any other billionaire compared with 2010, Forbes said. “It wasn’t even close this year,” he said. Slim’s Holdings Slim’s America Movil SAB is the biggest mobile-phone company in the Americas, with 225 million wireless subscribers. The company also controls Mexico’s largest landline phone carrier, Telefonos de Mexico SAB, and the largest TV and long- distance operators in Brazil, as well as phone and video carriers in Colombia, Peru and other South American countries. His holdings in Mexico extend from retail, with the Sanborns department store chain, to banking and construction. He holds stakes in U.S. companies including the New York Times Co. (NYT), Saks Inc. (SKS) and Bronco Drilling Co. Slim’s gains in 2010 included his bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, which surged 42 percent as it expanded its branches, and Grupo Carso SAB, which almost doubled as it prepared for spinoffs of its mining and real- estate units. Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 after dropping out of Harvard University and since then the company has become the world’s largest software maker. Gates’ holdings include about 581 million shares of Microsoft, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock lost 0.5 percent during the past year as of Feb. 14, the date the rankings are based on. (Agencies)
