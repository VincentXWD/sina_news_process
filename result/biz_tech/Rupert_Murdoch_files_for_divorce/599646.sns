Rupert Murdoch appears to be seeking a quiet divorce, based on the lawyer he has chosen and the absence of incendiary allegations, people with knowledge of the case and experience of high-profile New York divorces said.Divorce papers filed by the media mogul on Thursday comprised a short document saying the marriage is irretrievably broken, according to a person with knowledge of the filing. The document, which formally starts a divorce action under New York’s no-fault law, contains no details of wrongdoing, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.That, his choice of lawyer and a series of pre- and post-nuptial agreements all favour a strategy for ending his 14-year marriage to Wendi Deng Murdoch as quickly and quietly as possible, the experts said.“While she might try to get more money somehow, and he might be willing to give it to her because he’s got so much money, it seems to me she’s bound by all those agreements,” said John Vassallo, who has represented rock star Mick Jagger and movie star Harvey Keitel in divorce proceedings.Ira Garr, representing Rupert Murdoch, was referred to the case through a lawyer at News Corp, the Murdoch media empire, the person with knowledge of the divorce filing said. He may have been hired because of a reputation for settling divorces quietly and because he is friendly with Pamela Sloan, the lawyer representing Wendi Deng, the person said.Among his previous divorce clients were businessman Donald Trump’s former wife Ivana Trump and federal judge Kimba Wood. Sloan’s firm, Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan, LLP. Sloan, helped represent actress Katie Holmes in her divorce from actor Tom Cruise.(Agencies)
