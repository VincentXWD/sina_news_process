The secretary of a former high-ranking economic planning official under investigation for possible corruption has also been taken for questioning by Party disciplinary investigators as part of a probe that appears to be widening, a newspaper reported yesterday.The secretary, Wang Yong, was described in press accounts as the right-hand man of Liu Tienan, a former deputy director of China's National Development and Reform Commission and former chief of the National Energy Administration.Wang has worked for Liu for nearly a decade, the Peninsula Morning Post reported yesterday. Wang entered the National Energy Administration after Liu was appointed director in December 2010.The newspaper said sources inside the administration said Wang has been taken away for investigation for more than 20 days.Liu last month became one of the latest high-level officials to become ensnared in the new leadership's anti-corruption drive.The Communist Party of China's disciplinary agency said in a one-sentence statement last month that Liu was being investigated for "suspected serious disciplinary violations."In December, Luo Changping, deputy editor-in-chief of Caijing magazine, said in his Weibo that Liu had shady ties with a businessman, was involved in large, problematic bank loans and fabricated his academic qualifications.A woman described as Liu's mistress reportedly provided information that Liu had helped defraud banks of US$200 million, according to reports.
