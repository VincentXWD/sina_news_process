The Wikileaks anti-secrecy website says it helped Edward Snowden leave Hong Kong and find political asylum in what it calls "a democratic country".Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has accused US President Barack Obama of going back on a promise to run a transparent administration and called Snowden a hero.For the past year, Assange has been at the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault. He says the claims are politically motivated, and that he would be sent to the US to face similar charges of exposing state secrets.
