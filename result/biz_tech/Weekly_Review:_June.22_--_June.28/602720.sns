Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise joined Jerry Bruckheimer at his star ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Filmmaker Jerry Bruckheimer was joined by famous friends Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise at the Monday ceremony celebrating his induction to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The "Lone Ranger" producer, 67, who also helmed the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise and "Top Gun" among many other hit films, celebrated his star with some warm words from Depp."These days the word legend gets bandied around all too easily, but not here and not today," Depp, 50, said. "My path was fortunate enough to collide with this man some years ago, and certainly since my collaboration with Jerry, my life has never been the same and probably won't be for a while, anyway.""Without Jerry there would be no 'Pirates' there would be no Captain Jack, there would be no revived 'Lone Ranger,' there would be no reinvigorated Tonto. So I have a lot to thank him for."(Agencies)Â
