Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt reportedly want two more children, bringing their brood's total to eight.Following a recent trip to Syria, Angelina, 38, now has her heart set on adopting a refugee from Jordan while she and Brad, 49, are also hoping to have another biological child together.Brad and Ange already have three adopted children – Maddox, Pax and Zahara – while also having three biological children Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.Well it’s a good job Hollywood’s finest can afford a house big enough, then.A source revealed: “Angie and Brad’s attitude towards kids is the more the better — and that once you have several a few more makes no difference.“She has been particularly touched by the situation in Syria and wants to adopt a child from Jordan to do her bit to help.“The publicity would help draw the world’s attention to what’s going on there.“The twins are now four and Angie and Brad have agreed it’s time for more kids.“They’re crossing their fingers that they’ll bring their next child home soon. She is friends with Queen Rania of Jordan, so that has got to help with adopting a child.“But Angie and Brad also want to have one more biological child so she is eating a diet rich in potassium.”And it would seem that Angelina’s recent double mastectomy has been the catalyst for this decision, making the two realise that life is too short to not do what they want.The source continued: “Angie and Brad are even more into their family after her recent health scare. It has focused them on what’s important in life.”(Agencies)
