According to a Times Now report in India, the channel has received an intelligence note which says that China's People Liberation Army (PLA) has “intruded” into Bhutan, an important strategic partner of New Delhi in south Asia.The report said that the Chinese not only “set up three camps with PLA personnel to guard them” but were also “carrying out surveillance at two locations” on May 28.A massive diplomatic row had broke out between New Delhi and Beijing a few months ago after the Chinese Army was accused by India of“intruding” into the Indian territory in Ladakh and setting up tents there. The incident had caused irritants in the bilateral relations just ahead of the visit of the new Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.(Agencies)
