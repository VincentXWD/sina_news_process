The Brooklyn Nets have reached an agreement in principle with the Boston Celtics to acquire future Hall of Famers Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce after Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause, league sources told Yahoo! Sports.Garnett waived his no-trade clause after the Nets agreed to fully guarantee the $12 million owed him for the 2014-15 season, the third year of his contract. Prior to the agreement, the Nets could have bought out Garnett for $6 million.Garnett also was swayed by the chance to join his close friend, Pierce, in Brooklyn where they could play for longtime rival Jason Kidd.The trade can't be made official by the NBA until July 10.The trade comes with a heavy cost for the Nets: They face a luxury-tax bill of nearly $80 million. Their payroll will be close to $100 million.The deal centers around a package that sends Gerald Wallace, Tornike Shengelia, the expiring deal of Kris Humphries and three future first-round picks (2014, '16 and '18) to the Celtics, sources told Y! Sports.Celtics guard Jason Terry joins Garnett and Pierce in the package going to the Nets, sources said. The Nets also will send back Reggie Evans and do a sign-and-trade involving Keith Bogans and one more minimum-level player as part of package, a source said.For the Celtics, the chance to clear cap space and gain multiple future draft picks to start the franchise's rebuilding process would be the lure.The Golden State Warriors made an inquiry with Boston on Garnett on Wednesday, but there was no traction, league sources told Yahoo! Sports. The Celtics discussed a possible Pierce-Garnett package with Dallas, but it gained no momentum, sources said. Very few teams, if any, would have the inclination to trade three draft picks for a short-term run with two aging stars.(Agencies)
