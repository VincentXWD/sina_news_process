Former NBA star and provocateur Dennis Rodman delivered a message Sunday from the leader of the Democratic Poeple’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un to President Obama: Call me.Rodman, who has made headlines for several days as a result of his trip to DPRK with the Harlem Globetrotters, told ABC’s “This Week” that the 28-year-old leader “doesn’t want to do war.”Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim.He did the interview in the network’s New York studio dressed in sunglasses and a sports coat emblazoned with images of U.S. dollar bills.The trip took place amid strained ties between the United States and DPRK over that country’s recent underground nuclear test.The State Department on Friday distanced itself from Rodman's visit.Rodman said when Kim said he loved basketball, he said: "Obama loves basketball. Let's start there" as a way to warm up relations between the countries.The State Department also has criticized DPRK for "wining and dining" Rodman while its own people go hungry.Basketball is popular in DPRK, and an exhibition game Thursday with two Americans playing on each team alongside DPRK’s ended in a 110-110 tie. Following the game Kim threw an "epic feast" for the group, plying them with food and drinks and making round after round of toasts.(Agencies)
