By Jia Xiaoguang, Sina EnglishCui Yongyuan, famous host of China Central Television (CCTV) and a committee member of Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), voiced his distrust of the quality of the domestic milk powder during the first session of the 12th CPPCC on Mar. 3rdWidely known for his candid and witty style, Cui made no attempts to tone down his remarks on the homemade milk powder brands notorious for their quality problems.“Of course I have no confidence in it.” Cui responded frankly to the question of whether he still “has confidence in China’s milk powder”.The safety issue of China’s milk powder has again attracted spotlight on the eve of the nation’s annual “two sessions”, i.e. the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the CPPCC, as triggered by a rigorous purchase restriction on milk powder issued by Hong Kong authority going into effect from Mar 1st.The quota policy is intended to curb the buying spree primarily by mainland tourists who are daunted by the milk powder quality scandals that keep popping up in Chinese mainland.On the press conference of the advisory body’s first session on Mar 2nd, the CPPCC spokesman Lv Xinhua claimed that 99% of the milk powder in mainland has no quality problem, which he said later was only a citation of the figure provided by the General Administration of Quality Inspection.“I’ve got no idea where to find the problematic 1%.” Cui Yongyuan said when asked to comment on Lv’s words.
