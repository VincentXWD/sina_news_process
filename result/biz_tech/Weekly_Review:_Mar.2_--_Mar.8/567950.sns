S.Korean media quoted military sources as saying Sunday that "Chinese warships have regularly patrolled waters within the South Korean Navy's operational zone in the Yellow Sea without prior notification".China's destroyers and escort vessels have entered the so-called area of operations (AO) under the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) in the Yellow Sea once or twice a week to conduct search maneuvers, South Korea military sources said. They did not specify when the patrols started.Yonhap News Agency said the KADIZ was designated by the commander of the U.S. Pacific Air Force Command in 1951 to prevent air clashes between nations surrounding the Korean Peninsula.Yonhap admitted that the area is not South Korean airspace, but still the country's military "supervises the zone and foreign aircraft must receive approval from the military 24 hours prior to entering the zone".South Korea's Navy chief earlier this month vowed to strengthen naval forces to cope with rising tensions in Northeast Asia.South Korea Adm. Choi Yoon-hee said the Navy will push to create two more naval task forces in the next two decades to respond to provocations from DPRK and safely protect its territory.(Agencies)
