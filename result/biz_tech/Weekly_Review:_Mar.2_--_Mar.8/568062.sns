Japan’s coastguard arrested the captain of a Chinese boat on suspicion of illegal fishing in "its exclusive economic zone" on Tuesday, officials said, amid a territorial row between the two countries.The coral fishing boat with a crew of 11 was spotted by a coastguard patrol plane in waters some 44 kilometers (27 miles) northeast of Miyako island in the Okinawan chain, the coastguard official said.The captain, 44, whose name has yet to be disclosed, was arrested on suspicion of fishing in the exclusive maritime zone without permission from Japan, the coastguard said.“After receiving information from our airplane, three of our patrol boats approached the Chinese ship, and they are now sailing back to Miyako with the Chinese ship,” the spokesman said.The incident occurred amid a simmering dispute over the Diaoyu Islands. Miyako is located about 210 kilometers from the Diaoyu Islands.(Agencies)
