By Jia Xiaoguang, Sina EnglishHaste can hardly render rewards when a sober and gradual approach is required in harnessing air pollution, said Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), during a panel discussion at the first session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) on Mar 6.Touching on the recent haze that enshrouded a large swathe of China, Xi, recalling his childhood in Beijing, advocated patience and calmness in the face of grave problems.Beijng has been a city long beleaguered by sandstorm even since his childhood, Xi recalled. Everyday he went to school riding a bicycle and wearing a mask.The mask would always be covered with a thick layer of sand and dust upon his arrival at the school. It became even worse in winter when a huge amount of smog was discharged from coal burning, he added.Back then there was no PM 2.5 but PM 250, Xi said jokingly, which elicited a roar of laughter among the present participants.When the old problem was resolved, we should muster our strength to address all the emerging problems, Xi proceeded. In the meantime, we should also refrain from rushing for a quick result since old and new problems cannot be settled simultaneously in Chinese society.
