By Yu Runze, Sina EnglishWu Shimin, deputy director of State Ethnic Affairs Commission (SEAC), proposed to improve the family planning policy and allow couples to have more than one child in panel discussions Thursday afternoon.“There are three essential elements (land, population and state power organ) that are of vital importance to nation's economy and the people's livelihood, long-term interest and national rise and fall. Over the past 30 years, the family planning, namely the one-child policy, has made great contribution in curbing the population growth,” Wu said.However, the side effects of the policy also become prominent. Wu pointed out several urgent problems.First, the policy results in an aging society. By 2020, the aging population in China will exceed 200 million. And by 2050, the aging people will account for 1/3 of the whole population.Second, the policy has already obstructed society vitality. To some degree, the dividends of the over 30 years’ reform are human capital advantage. Now, labor shortage has already become an urgent issue in coastal provinces.Third, the policy also raises some social problems. Due to the deep-rooted traditional concepts over children, the baby trafficking persists though government makes great efforts to creak down on the crime. Meanwhile, more and more couples choose to have no child. For example, Shanghai has over 1 million dink families.“All in all, family planning policy is closely related to China’s long-term interest and lasting stability. But calculation based on the development rate shows that ending one-child policy will not lead to population explosion,” Wu concluded.
