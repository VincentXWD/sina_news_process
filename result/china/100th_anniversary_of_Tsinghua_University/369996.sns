Founded in 1911, Tsinghua University will usher in her centennial anniversary in 2011.The logo for the centennial celebration of Tsinghua University is a combination of the Arabic numeral "100" and the shape of the school's old auditorium, all accented by the statement "1911-2011." The old auditorium is one of the university's most significant buildings, embodying the profound accumulation of historical and humanitarian spirit within a hundred-year-old institution of higher learning. The Arabic numeral "100" symbolizes a joyous greeting for the university's centennial anniversary.At the top of the logo is the old auditorium's dome, which is designed like the rising sun to symbolize that Tsinghua University, despite its age, has always been full of youthful brilliance. The pyramid-like arch in the middle of the logo is a symbol of the universityâ€™s mission to cultivate top-notch creative talent and maintain her position at the peak of academia. The logo's color originates from the red brick of the auditorium, representing both the joyful atmosphere of the celebration and the special character of the university.
