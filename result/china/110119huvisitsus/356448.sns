WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao landed in the U.S. capital of Washington Tuesday for a four-day state visit aimed at enhancing the positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship between China and the United States."I look forward to having in-depth discussions with President (Barack) Obama on China-U.S. relations and major international and regional issues of shared interest," President Hu said in a statement released upon his arrival at the airport.He said the purpose of his visit is to enhance mutual trust, promote friendship, deepen cooperation and move forward the positive, cooperative and comprehensive China-U.S. relationship for the 21st century."I also look forward to meeting American friends from various sectors to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples," he said.Noting that the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, Hu said China and the United States have growing common interests and responsibilities and enjoy broader prospect for cooperation.Hu said the long-term, sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations is conducive to the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American peoples and to world peace and development."China stands ready to work with the United States to actively develop China-U.S. relations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit and join all other countries in a common effort to build a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity," Hu said.In the statement, Hu lauded the wholly sound momentum of growth in Sino-U.S. relations over the past three decades, citing fruitful cooperation in a wide range of areas and productive communication and coordination on major international and regional affairs."Our cooperation has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples and played an important role in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond," Hu said.During the visit, his second to the United States as head of state of China, President Hu and his U.S. counterpart Obama will map out a blueprint together for China-U.S. cooperation for the new era, Chinese officials said.The two leaders are expected to have extensive and in-depth discussions on major topics of mutual interest when they meet for talks at the White House on Wednesday.Before their Wednesday talks, Obama will host a small private dinner in the Old Family Room at the White House for President Hu Tuesday evening, hours after the Chinese leader's arrival."It's a very unusual -- unusually small dinner that we'll have with President Hu, again reflecting the relationship that we are evolving, and the opportunity to have candid conversation in much less formal settings than you typically would see, frankly, in a meeting between the Chinese and the United States," U.S. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon told reporters last Friday.The Chinese leader will be welcomed at a formal ceremony given by Obama at the White House ahead of their talks. Obama will host Hu for an official state dinner on Wednesday night.According to Chinese officials, during his visit, President Hu will meet with people from various walks of life in the United States, and elaborate on the domestic and foreign policies of the Chinese government and on how to advance China-U.S. relations in the new era.The two sides are expected to sign a series of important cooperation documents and announce a host of new cooperation projects in economy and trade, energy, environmental protection, infrastructure development, science and technology and people-to-people exchanges.　[1]　[2]　[Next]
