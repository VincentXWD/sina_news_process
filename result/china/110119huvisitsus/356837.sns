？WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao on Thursday called upon the U.S. Congress to continue helping the two countries boost their relations.Pursuing a healthy and steady development of China-U.S. ties is China's established policy and strategic choice, Hu stressed in talks here with Speaker John Boehner of the House and Majority leader Harry Reid of the Senate.It has also been the consensus of the U.S. administrations, whether Republican or Democratic, since the two countries established formal diplomatic relations 32 years ago, he added.Thanks to the two nations' concerted efforts, the China-U.S. relationship has been moving forward steadily, Hu said, citing the two countries' increasing cooperation and coordination on trade, terrorism, climate change, Korean Peninsula denuclearization and other bilateral, regional and global issues.A sound relationship between Beijing and Washington not only serves the fundamental interests of both peoples, but greatly contributes to the peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, the Chinese president said.With China and the United States differing in culture, social system and development level, it is normal for the two sides to have differences on some issues, he said.But what matters most is the common interests of the two countries, he stressed, saying that Beijing's position is that the two sides should seek common ground while reserving differences, so as to learn from each other and pursue common prosperity on the basis of mutual respect and equality.？China is ready to work together with the U.S. side to enhance communication, mutual trust and cooperation, and work for a China-U.S. cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit, he said.Emphasizing that China and the United States are two large economies and have great potential for economic and trade cooperation, he said as long as both sides apply an open, cooperative and win-win approach, the China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation will certainly make more achievements and bring more tangible benefits to both peoples.The Chinese president said parliamentary exchanges are an important part of China-U.S. relations, noting that an increasing number of U.S. lawmakers have been advocating and pushing for a stronger bilateral relationship.The National People's Congress of China and the U.S. Congress have conducted frequent friendly exchanges and played an active role in promoting mutual understanding between the two nations, Hu said.China, he said, hopes that the U.S. Congress will continue backing and actively engaging in exchanges between the two countries' legislatures and make greater contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations.Boehner, for his part, welcomed Hu's visit to the House, and stressed that the advancing bilateral relationship, including the increasingly robust economic cooperation, benefits both sides.Reid noted that China plays an important role on major international affairs, and U.S. senators are fully aware of the significance of U.S.-China relations.The United States and China share common interests in many fields and have seen their economies increasingly interconnected, Reid said, adding that China's investment in the United States helps create U.S. jobs.The U.S. Senate is willing to help boost China's investment in the United States and hopes that the two sides will strengthen cooperation in clean energy and tourism among other fields, he said.Also present at the talks were a number of heavyweight lawmakers from both chambers, including Minority leader Nancy Pelosi of the House, Chairman John Kerry of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and top Republican John McCain of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
