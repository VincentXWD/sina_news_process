DALIAN, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on Wednesday that major developed economies should adopt responsible and effective fiscal and monetary policies, properly handle debt issues, ensure the safety and stable operation of investment in the market, and maintain confidence of investors around the world."Governments should fulfill their responsibilities and put their own house in order," Wen said in a keynote speech at the opening of the World Economic Forum annual meeting of "New Champions 2001", a three-day event held in the city of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province.The world economic recovery will be a long-term, difficult and complicated process, given to sovereign debt in some countries, high unemployment in major advanced economies and upward inflationary pressure in emerging economies, he said."We need to have confidence, strengthen cooperation and live up to our responsibility," he said. "We should strengthen dialogue and coordination on macroeconomic policy and accelerate the building of a just, equitable, sound and stable new world economic order."
