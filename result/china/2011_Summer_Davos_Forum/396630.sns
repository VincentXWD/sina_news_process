DALIAN, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday urged the United States to maintain fiscal and financial stability to protect investors' interests."We hope the U.S. will carry out appropriate economic policies and maintain fiscal and financial stability to protect the interests and confidence of investors," Wen said at the opening of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in China's northeastern city of Dalian.The U.S. currently faces the three tasks of controlling its external debt, reducing the fiscal deficit, and creating jobs through economic growth, the premier said in a keynote speech.He reiterated calls on Washington to allow Chinese enterprises to invest more in the U.S. market and loosen restrictions on exports to China, which he said will help increase employment in the U.S.."We believe the United States is capable of overcoming difficulties and achieving a full economic recovery," said Wen.China is willing to launch large-scale financial and economic cooperation with the United States, he said.In face of the sovereign debt crises in some European countries and higher inflationary pressure caused by the fluctuating exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, China must first handle its own issues well and meanwhile promote reforms of the international economic and financial systems, said Wen.He also urged efforts to prevent the European debt crisis from spreading further.
