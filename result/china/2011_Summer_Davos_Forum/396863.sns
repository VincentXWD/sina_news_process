DALIAN, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Although the global economic picture seemed bleak to many of those attending an international forum Wednesday in Dalian, they still expressed confidence in world economy, particularly that of China.More than 1,500 participants -- including 600 chief executive officers -- from around the world gathered in the port city of northeast China's Liaoning Province for the annual meeting of the "New Champions" of the World Economic Forum (WEF), exchanging visions on the global economic outlook.In his keynote speech at the opening of the WEF meeting, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reassured global business elites that the new developments, both internationally and in China, have not changed the fundamentals of China's growth."China's economy is generally in good shape. We will continued to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy," Wen said.In the first half of 2011, China's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 9.6 percent year-on-year and the increase in the consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, weakened to 6.2 percent year-on-year in August from a 37-month high of 6.5 percent in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.But as the world economy slowly recovers, uncertainties and destabilizing factors grow, Wen said, citing the sovereign debt risks in the EU and high unemployment in the Untied States.Wen noted that as the size of the Chinese economy grows, it will become difficult to maintain high-speed growth for the long term."But we in China remain clear-headed and are firm in our confidence," Wen said.Over the last 10 years, China has grown into the world's second largest economy with an annual growth rate of 10.5 percent.The slower economic growth since the second quarter was mostly the result of proactive macro regulations, Wen said.To help stabilize the world economy and boost growth, Wen said he hoped the United States would give wider market access to Chinese investors and relax its export controls to China.Noting China's willingness to increase its investment in Europe, Wen urged the EU to recognize China's market economy status as a good gesture before 2016 when China will automatically acquire the status according to World Trade Organization rules.
