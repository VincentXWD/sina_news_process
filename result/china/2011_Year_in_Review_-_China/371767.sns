BEIJING -- The State Council, or China's Cabinet, on Wednesday pledged to increase both the depth and scope of Party and government financial information released to the public in a bid to enhance public transparency."The openness of financial budgets still falls short of people's expectations as some departments lag behind in making their budgets public and some information released is not detailed enough," read a statement released after a regular meeting of the State Council.The statement urged Party and government departments to manage their funds in accordance with the law, make their financial information public in more areas and provide more details in released content, especially in regards to using funds for overseas trips, vehicle purchases and official receptions.In China, some Party and government officials purchased luxury cars for their units and used them for personal matters, and unnecessary celebrations, seminars and forums were held using government funds, triggering widespread public concern.According to the meeting, a total of 98 Party and government departments at the central level should make their financial budgets public this year after the documents are approved by the National People's Congress.Meanwhile, the State Council vowed to increase efforts in pushing local governments to release their budget records.Also during Wednesday's meeting, an amendment to the Law on the Prevention and Cure of Occupational Disease, aimed at improving the system of occupational disease diagnosis, was discussed.The meeting was presided over by Premier Wen Jiabao.
