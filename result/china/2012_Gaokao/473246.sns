Liang Shi, 45, is preparing for his 16th College Entrance Examination in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Dubbed the "Gaokao nail household", he failed to enter college for the 15th time in 2011, lacking 64 marks. Now he spends six hours for preparation time each day. He said if he fails this time again, he will continue the fight to pass in 2013.Â
