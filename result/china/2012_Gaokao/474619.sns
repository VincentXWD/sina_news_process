Henan province is said to live broadcast its college entrance examination to help prevent cheating.The country's biggest annual exam is in the process. While students are bent on "one of the most important moments in life", the authorities are also busy preparing for cheaters.There were several reported group cheating incidents in Henan, in 2004, causing the government to step up their preventative efforts.This year, they will further supplement their efforts with the live video monitoring and broadcast at all testing locations in the province.The province will also increase punishments for cheaters. A test-taker who cheats will be disqualified for all subjects in the test and will be not allowed to attend the test the following year. A serious violator will be prohibited from taking any national education-related tests for one to three years.Â
