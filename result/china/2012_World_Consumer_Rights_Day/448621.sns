Raising community awareness on consumer rights protection is the goal of a month-long programme of activities to be held in HCM City.The HCM City Department of Industry and Trade (DoIT) is organising the activities throughout the city with the theme, "Our Money, Our Rights," on March 15, the official World Consumer Rights Day.Every year, the day unites consumers worldwide and promotes activities that aim to protect consumer rights and interests.The programme is organised by DoIT in collaboration with the HCM City Consumer Rights Protection Association, Competitiveness Management Department, Viet Nam Science and Technology Joint Stock Company and Thuy Nguyet Trading and Production Consulting Company.The activities also aim to raise awareness about fake and low-quality products, as well as trademark protection, according to the DoIT.As part of the programme, a seminar will be held on March 14 to disseminate new regulations related to the Consumer Rights Protection Law, focusing on businesses and importers in the city.It will also provide opportunities for discussions between State management agencies and businesses about policies and issues related to consumer protection.At the seminar, businesses and the HCM City Consumer Rights Protection Association are expected to sign commitments to protect consumer rights.An outdoors meeting to raise awareness about consumer rights will be organised on March 15 at the Lotte Mart shopping centre in District 6 for 500-800 people.After the meeting, a road show manned by volunteers on bicycles will ride through the city carrying slogans on consumer rights protection.Between March 14 and 20, the DoIT will hang banners with information on consumer rights on several streets.Tran Vinh Nhung, deputy director of DoIT, said the entire society should become more aware of consumer rights and protection.According to the Consumer Rights Protection Law which became effective last year, consumers have eight basic rights: the right to be satisfied with their basic needs; the right to safety; the right to be informed; the right to choose; the right to be heard; the right for redress; the right for consumer information; and the right to live in a healthy and sustainable environment.However, Vietnamese consumers are not yet aware of these rights. "For the law to be enforced effectively, the State, businesses and consumers must take joint actions. Consumers must be aware of their rights to be able to protect themselves," he noted.Ngo Bach Phong, deputy chairman of HCM City Consumer Rights Protection Association, said consumers should be aware that they hold power, citing the successful lawsuit against the Taiwanese MSG producer Vedan as a clear example.Consumers protected their rights by refusing to buy Vedan's products, he added.(Agencies)
