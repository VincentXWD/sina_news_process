Proposals from legislators and members of the country's top political advisory body that aim to address social concerns always arouse public curiosity, but some unintentionally stoke controversy. Known as "leiren (shocking) proposals," they are usually met with ridicule and scorn.Such proposals inevitably become hot topics as the public is confused about how National People's Congress (NPC) deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) members could submit such outlandish recommendations.Zhu Lieyu, a lawyer and NPC deputy from Guangdong Province, proposed softening the punishment for officials convicted of corruption. His suggestion was met with public outcry and criticism from people who questioned whether Zhu represents the people or corrupt officials.Meanwhile, Mu Linru, property magnate and CPPCC member, urged a loosening of government real estate controls, saying that there was nothing unreasonable about homes sold for even 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) per square meter if both the buyer and seller agreed to such a deal.More often than not, deputies and members who submit "leiren proposals" are outspoken newcomers to the political arena."We should be more tolerant of those who submit shocking proposals," Ge Jianxiong, a CPPCC member, told the Global Times. "They are elected without their consent and often haven't carefully studied what kind of procedures they should follow in making proposals or comments."Proposals, regardless of whether they were made to the NPC or CPPCC, should be rooted in research of related cases and reflect public opinion. These proposals will then go through committees to be decided whether they are suitable for legislation."Leiren proposals" expose representatives of the people who aren't appropriately motivated to fulfill their obligation."We should hold a swearing-in ceremony for representations to remind us all that [the two sessions] is serious," Ge said.
