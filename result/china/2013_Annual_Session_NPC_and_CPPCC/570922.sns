Monetary policies to cool home prices in China will continue or even strengthen in the future, said the country's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan at a press conference on Wednesday.The measures include down payment rates, special interests rates for housing loans and other measures, Zhou said.These are structural monetary policies instead of overall monetary policies, he said.Monetary policies mainly focus on dealing with overall demand and usually make changes based on consumer price index (CPI) and production material prices, Zhou said.He made the remarks at a news conference on China's currency policy and financial reform, which was held on the sidelines of the first annual session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC).
