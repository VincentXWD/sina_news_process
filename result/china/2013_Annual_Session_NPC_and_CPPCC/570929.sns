China's central bank governor stresses prudent, neutral monetary policyChina's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan Wednesday reiterated that the country's monetary policy will stay prudent and neutral in 2013.China aims to keep its broad money supply (M2), which covers cash in circulation and all deposits, to grow at 13 percent this year and targets the inflation rate at 3.5 percent.The 13 percent growth of M2 is smaller than that of last year, which indicates that the government puts more emphasis on keeping stable consumer prices, Zhou told a press conference on the sidelines of the annual legislative session.The M2 growth target also means the monetary policy will stay prudent and neutral, he said.China implemented a relatively easy monetary policy in 2008 to cope with the global financial crisis. At the end of 2010, the monetary policy was turned to prudent with the economy gradually recovering.China should remain on high alert for inflationChina's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Wednesday that China should remain on high alert for inflation and the bank will take measures, including monetary policy adjustments, to stabilize prices.Zhou made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the parliament's annual session.China's consumer price index (CPI), the main gauge of inflation, rebounded to a 10-month high of 3.2 percent in February.Zhou attributed the higher-than-expected index partly to the lower comparison base last year as the data was calculated on a year-on-year basis.On a month-on-month basis, February's CPI gained 1.1 percent from the previous month.China aims to hold this year's consumer price growth at around 3.5 percent, lower than the 4-percent target for 2012 but higher than last year's actual inflation rate of 2.6 percent.Monetary measures to cool home prices to continueMonetary policies to cool home prices in China will continue or even strengthen in the future, said the country's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan at a press conference on Wednesday.The measures include down payment rates, special interests rates for housing loans and other measures, Zhou said.These are structural monetary policies instead of overall monetary policies, he said.Monetary policies mainly focus on dealing with overall demand and usually make changes based on consumer price index (CPI) and production material prices, Zhou said.He made the remarks at a news conference on China's currency policy and financial reform, which was held on the sidelines of the first annual session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC).
