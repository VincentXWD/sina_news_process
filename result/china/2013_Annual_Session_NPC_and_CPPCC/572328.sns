The work report of the Supreme People's Court received the lowest number of votes of the six resolutions that deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) approved on Sunday, the last day of the congress.Deputies said the large number of votes against adopting the court's report was a sign of growing social democracy and reflected an increasing demand for the rule of law.A total of 2,948 deputies to the NPC voted on the six draft resolutions at the close of the First Session of the 12th NPC in Beijing. All six were adopted.Adoption of the Supreme People's Court work report was opposed by 605 delegates, the most of the six resolutions.Huang Qifan, a deputy and the Chongqing mayor said that the negative votes showed the Supreme People's Court was unfairly being blamed for the numerous controversies that originated mainly in lower courts. "The supreme court is only responsible for the management of the central government's legal work. There are many grass-root courts in China. It is unfair for the Supreme Court to take all the blame," he said.The work report from the Supreme People's Procuratorate got 485 negative votes and was adopted with an approval rating of 79.42 percent. The government work report was adopted with an approval rating of 95.07, the highest of the six resolutions.Some deputies said that judicial justice was essential to protect social equity and justice. The entire legislative system could lose public support if the courts and prosecutors are seen to be above the law."We can only say our judicial system has improved significantly when the reports of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate are adopted at the same approval rating as the government's work report," Chen Zhenhao, a deputy, said.
