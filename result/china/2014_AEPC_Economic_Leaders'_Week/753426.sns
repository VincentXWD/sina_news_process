by Xinhua writer Luo JunBEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Mutual trust and cooperation underpin all efforts to enhance relations between countries, let alone efforts to build relations between major powers.With mutual trust and cooperation, relations prosper; without them, relations wither.The fundamental reason why China and Russia are enjoying smooth relations is because the two countries have a high level of mutual trust, which ensures their deep and comprehensive practical cooperation.Likewise, a healthy development of the Sino-U.S. relations is also attributed to the mutual trust and cooperation they are upholding.Due to the heavy weight of major-country relations, bilateral talks between leaders of major countries on the occasion of the APEC meetings in Beijing have drawn worldwide attention, especially the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama, and that between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.It is a unique and precious opportunity for the leaders to cement mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation and add to the momentum of building harmonious bilateral ties.Xi has met with Putin as many as nine times since he took office last year, testifying the solid relations between their two countries.Despite many obstacles and differences, the Sino-U.S. ties have managed to forge ahead thanks to the two countries' joint efforts to assure each other of their intentions and their sincerity to advance all-round cooperation.It is a blessing for the world that big countries like China and the United States have reached consensus on building a new model of major-country relations based on mutual respect, cooperation and non-confrontation. Of course, translating the consensus into reality requires wisdom, sincerity and numerous concrete actions.Cultivating mutual trust and deepening practical cooperation should be recognized as important cornerstones of relations between all nations as well as world peace and prosperity.Therefore, it is advisable for world leaders to avail themselves of all opportunities, currently the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, to exchange opinions, build mutual trust and facilitate win-win cooperation.With increasingly intertwined common interests and profound stakes in one another's success, all countries, especially big countries like China, the United States, Russia and Japan, should endeavor to construct mutual trust and enhance win-win cooperation so as to achieve common development.
