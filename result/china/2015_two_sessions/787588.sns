BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-corruption effort "has no limit or ceiling" and "no one has impunity," a spokesman of the Chinese political advisory body said on Monday.Lyu Xinhua, spokesman for the third session of the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remark when asked to comment on media reports that there might be "bigger tigers", or senior-level corrupt officials, brought down in the country's anti-corruption drive.Over the past year, the Communist Party of China made an all-out effort, adopted a "zero-tolerance attitude" and "left no stones untouched" in fighting against corruption, said the spokesman.Endeavors have been made to create a political climate in which officials "dare not, cannot and wish not commit corruption," with good progress being achieved, he said.Lyu said he personally held that there is no point in making such speculations on "bigger tigers" but it is perfectly understandable that the general public and media believe that if "bigger tigers" do exist, they should be exposed."In fighting against corruption, it is important to deal with any and all corruption cases brought to our attention," said the spokesman.Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to target high-ranking "tigers" as well as low-ranking "flies" in his anti-corruption drive since the new leadership took office in 2013.The sweeping campaign has brought down a number of high-profile officials, such as Zhou Yongkang, Xu Caihou, Ling Jihua and Su Rong.
