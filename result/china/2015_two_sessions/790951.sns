BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday called to strengthen China's national defense and the combativeness of its armed forces, by greater civil-military integration.Xi, also chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while joining a plenary meeting of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation at the ongoing legislative session.The armed forces should fully implement the strategic layout of "Four Comprehensives" and the development strategy of civil-military integration in order to break new grounds in the PLA's capability building, Xi said.The "Four Comprehensives," a political concept unveiled by Xi last year which was elevated as a main theme of this year's parliamentary session, refers to comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society, deepening reform, advancing the rule of law and strictly governing the Party.Xi noted that over the past year, the PLA had redoubled efforts to carry out real combat-like military trainings, improve the Party's work style and fight corruption, and to contemplate advancing military reforms. Remarkable achievements have been made in the PLA's capacity-building.For a long time, Xi said, China has witnessed synchronized development in its economic and national defense capabilities thanks to civil-military integration.But the president acknowledged that the implementation of the key national strategy remained at a preliminary phase, pointing to problems emerged in the process, such as the lack of top-level coordination, lax implementation among others.Efforts must be made to ensure "coordinated, balanced and compatible development" of the country's economic and national defense capabilities, he said.Xi's words were echoed in a government work report delivered by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on March 5.Addressing lawmakers from across the country, Li said "we will coordinate national defense development and economic development and deepen the integration of the military and civil sectors."Governments at all levels must always take an active interest in and support the strengthening of our national defense and armed forces, and remain committed to consolidating and increasing the unity between the government and the armed forces and between the people and the armed forces, Li said.Xi Jinping also called for further integration of military and civilian undertakings that could cover multiple areas and generate high returns, and urged military and local authorities to advance work while taking into accounts the overall development of the entire Party and the country.Their work should follow the guidance from the central government and meet the market demands, Xi said, adding that a systematic mechanism that features effective incentives should be put in place.He also underline supervision and accountability in the implementation of the civil-military integration stragety, which should be put in the framework of law, he said.Calling civil-military integration a unique advantage enjoyed by Chinese armed forces, Xi urged the PLA to actively take part in and reinforce local economic and social development, and contribute to people's well-being through actual deeds.Meanwhile, local Party committees and governments should offer greater support for national defense and the PLA's capacity-buiding and work to fortify ties between the armed forces and the government and people, in order to pool strength for the Chinese dream and the dream of a stronger army, Xi said.
