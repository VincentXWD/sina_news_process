Premier gives encouragement to entrepreneursThe government will continue to offer more convenience to encourage people to start their own businesses in 2015, aiming to continue boost market vitality, Premier Li said."People shouldn't have to go to so much trouble to get their business registered," Li said, adding that market access will be further relaxed in 2015 and business license registration will become easier.Li said he met a retired woman last year who wanted to start a wedding service company because she was well versed with the practices of traditional wedding ceremonies.He added that during his visits to venture cafes and maker spaces, he had met many gifted young people."When their ideas are put into practice and they produce actual products, they actually boost market demand. I believe there are a lot of people with real talents, and we must lift all the restrictions so that they can make the best use of their talents," Li said.Corruption crackdown to strengthenChina will strengthen efforts to fight corruption and severely punish officials who do not carry out their responsibilities, Premier Li said."Government officials should use their position to better serve the public rather than abuse their power for personal benefit," the premier said."We will seriously investigate those officials who are involved in misconduct or are reluctant to perform their duties," Li added.Fighting corruption and maintaining clean government remain top priorities for the authorities, he said.Streamlining administration is govt's self-reformPremier Li said he is determined to keep the reform process going despite the acute pain in the process, vowing to reduce more government power lists."The pain (of reform) is still there and is becoming more acute. The government is reforming itself. Vested interests will be upset. This is not nail-clipping but taking a knife to one’s own flesh. We are determined to keep going until the job is done," he said.Li acknowledged that some reform measures have yet to be fully implemented, pledging to step up efforts and cut "all non-government review items."He rejected concerns about the possible impact of the reform on China's economy."The reform of streamlining administration and delegating government powers will increase market vitality and allow us to cope with the slowdown," he said.Li says no stopping of reformsPremier Li Keqiang said he is determined to keep the reform process going despite the acute pain in the process, vowing to reduce more government power lists."The pain (of reform) is still there and is becoming more acute. The government is reforming itself. Vested interests will be upset. This is not nail-clipping but taking a knife to one's own flesh. We are determined to keep going until the job is done," he said.Li acknowledged that some reform measures have yet to be fully implemented, pledging to step up efforts and cut "all non-government review items."He rejected concerns about the possible impact of the reform on China's economy."The reform of streamlining administration and delegating government powers will increase market vitality and allow us to cope with the slowdown," he said.Li shops online, backs e-commercePremier Li promised to support e-commerce and express delivery as these sectors provide a strong boost to employment and consumption.The sound interaction between online shopping and physical stores has only boosted the vitality of the market, said Li."Everyone stands a chance to fly when there is favorable wind blowing from behind. I believe with the tail wind generated by our Internet Plus strategy we will be able to bring Chinese economy off to a new level," Li added.He also revealed at the press conference that he has bought several books online recently.Steady and sound development of housing industryPremier Li Keqiang said that the country plans to increase construction of welfare housing in dilapidated and run-down areas by one million houses each.As China's urbanization process speeds up, the housing demand will continue to rise. Housing policy should be adjusted according to local conditions to ensure steady and sound development of housing industry in the long run, said Li.China is open to foreign investment, Li added. The country is enhancing the convertibility of the yuan and it is the largest destination for foreign investment, with the figure currently standing at $120 billion."Housing is not just an economic issue, it concerns the people’s livelihood," Li said. "We need to meet the needs of low-income people."On Chinese nationals buying homes overseas, Li said China encourages citizens to make investments abroad and start companies but they must abide by local laws.BackgroundThe customary press conference given by the premier, wrapping up the third session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC), is inevitably the most-anticipated section during national lawmakers' 10-day convention in the capital city, the most important political season every year.Before the premier's Question & Answer section, NPC deputies adopted six draft resolutions, including the government work report, and a revision to the Legislation Law at the closing meeting of the third session.Premier Li delivered the government work report to nearly 3,000 NPC deputies on March 5, the opening day of the third session.
