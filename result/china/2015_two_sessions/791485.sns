CHINA has both responsibility and ability to safeguard the stability of its border areas with Myanmar, Premier Li Keqiang said today.His remarks came two days after Beijing lodged representations to Myanmar on the deadly bombing in a Chinese city bordering the conflict-hit country.A bomb dropped by a Myanmar warplane on Friday killed four Chinese people and injured nine others in Lincang of Yunnan Province."What happened was deeply distressing," Li said at a press conference after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session. "We have responsibility and ability to firmly safeguard stability in the border areas between the two countries and protect the life and property of our people."The premier also expressed his deep sympathy to the bereft families.China has warned that it will take a "firm and decisive action" to protect the safety of its people if any further deadly stray fire incident happens again.Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong has urged Myanmar to punish the perpetrators, as well as apologize to and compensate the families of the victims.Myanmar's warplanes have on several occasions crossed the China-Myanmar borders and stray fire has caused casualties and loss of property of the Chinese people.Chinese fighter jets patrolled over the China-Myanmar borders after the deadly bombing to "track, monitor, warn and chase away" Myanmar military planes flying close to the Chinese side.China earlier urged stability in its border areas with Myanmar as well as the warring northern part of the Southeast Asian country.The Chinese government has reiterated that what happened in northern Myanmar is the internal affair of the country.The relations between China and Myanmar, sharing a border line of over 2,000 km, have been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.
