Sino-Japanese relations are now facing both "a test and an opportunity" at a crucial time of the year commemorating the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Sunday.The root cause of the strain in bilateral relations lies in whether the war and history are viewed correctly, Li said at a press conference after the conclusion of the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature on Sunday.The year also marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).If Japanese leaders could face history squarely with a consistent view, there would be new opportunities to improve bilateral ties and favorable conditions would be created to enhance trade between the two sides, Li said.He reminded Japanese leaders of owning up to historical responsibilities for crimes committed by their predecessors during the war which deeply traumatized for the Chinese people.The Japanese people were also victims of the war, Li stressed.Many countries have made plans to hold commemorative activities for the anniversary. This is to remind people of the hard lessons learned from historical tragedies and never allow history to repeat itself, he said, reaffirming China's stance of safeguarding the outcomes of victory, the post-war order and international laws, as well as peace after World War II.
