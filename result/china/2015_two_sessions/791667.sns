The People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC), hailed the successful conclusion of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliamentary body, and urged to boost the rule of law in an editorial to be published Monday.The article stressed that the people's congress system is crucial to achieve consensus and promote the rule of law amid the challenges and opportunities in stabilizing growth, adjusting structures and ensuring the quality of economic and social development.During the session, the NPC deputies approved a number of important documents, including the government work report, the national economic and social development plan and the central budget. They also adopted the revision to the Legislation Law.Hailing the adoption of the revision as an example for "scientific and democratic legislation," the editorial expected the revised law to ensure a bigger role for legislation in guiding and promoting major reform while making the legislative efforts in line with the demand of economic and social development.The law expands legislative power from 49 cities in China to 288 nationwide, empowering their legislative bodies to make local laws.The article urged the NPC as well as local people's congresses to shoulder the key responsibilities for strengthening legislation, improving law enforcement, restricting and supervising officials' use of power and promoting democracy."Every decision made by state organs concerns the people's happiness, health and safety," it said, urging to regulate and improve the governance of the country with the law and stimulate the people's wisdom and power with democracy.
