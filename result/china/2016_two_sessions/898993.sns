BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday China and the United States can cooperate with each other in the Asia-Pacific region to maintain regional stability.Li made the remarks at a press conference after the conclusion of the annual session of China's top legislature.He said that China has always advocated stable surroundings and friendly relations with its neighbors, and concerted efforts of the countries in the region are needed to uphold stability and good neighborhood."It is natural that there are some differences between neighbors, but as long as we treat each other with sincerity and seek settlements with diplomatic and peaceful means, we are fully capable of maintaining regional stability," Li said.The premier also noted the roles of "countries from outside the region," such as the United States, in safeguarding regional peace."The U.S. has never left the Asia Pacific, we can cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region and properly handle our differences," the premier said.He said China needs a stable neighborhood and peaceful international environment for its development, which remains a top priority for the world's second largest economy.A growing China will be a staunch force to uphold global peace, which is also in the interests of China's neighbors, he said."We will remain committed to the path of peaceful development, but we will not waver in our resolve to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity," Li said. "The two are not contradictory.""We hope that all countries, either in or outside the region, will do more things beneficial to regional stability, rather than the opposite," he said.
