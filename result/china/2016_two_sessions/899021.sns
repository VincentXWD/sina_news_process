BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will continue to support the development of agriculture and enhance the wellbeing of farmers, Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday.Prices of agricultural products, especially the prices of corn, wheat and rice, are higher than those in international markets, mainly because "our labor productivity is quite low", Li said at a press conference following the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session.In future, China will pursue coordinated development between new type of urbanization and agricultural modernization, he said."We will help more farmers migrate to cities. They will be granted urban residency if they meet certain requirements. That is also another way to raise their income," Li said.Moderate scale of farming will be developed to boost labor productivity and enhance the competitiveness of agricultural products, Li said."We will not decrease the support for agriculture, and will not decrease support for farmers," said the premier.
