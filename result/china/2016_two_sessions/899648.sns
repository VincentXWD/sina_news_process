Some delegates to China's just concluded two sessions have poorly prepared their proposals to the annual political event, observers said.Zhuang Deshui, deputy director of the Research Center for Government Integrity-Building at Peking University, cited as an example proposals made by many delegates to create new festivals and holidays in China, including a national reading day and a national day for filial piety.A delegate of National People's Congress (NPC) Chen Zhimin had proposed to set March 15, the birth date of NÃ¼wa, a half-human, half-python goddess in Chinese mythology, as Mother's Day for Chinese.However, March 15 is already recognized as International Consumer Rights Day in China. And holidays already crowd China's calendar, with the busiest day being March 21, known as seven holidays including World Day for children's song, poet, sleeping, forestry, and Down's syndrome.Though the intent to promote culture was praiseworthy, a thorough study is required to find a more effective solution, added Zhuang.Separately, delegates from the Jiusan Society, one of China's democratic parties, proposed that current bills and coins in circulation be demonetized and replaced with a new set, as corrupt officials who own large amounts of cash will rush to the banks to have their money, and would therefore be noticed and arrested, Guangzhou-based Nandu Daily reported on March 5.Zhuang pointed out that some of the proposals were poorly-prepared, submitted hastily before the deadline, which is unjustifiable since they have a year to prepare. He also recommended that the NPC and National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) post all proposals and bills online to pressure delegates into putting more effort.Such proposals show a lack of thorough study, which is not rare as NPC delegates and members of the national committee of the CPPCC only serve part-time, Wang Ming, a professor at Tsinghua University and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for three consecutive years, told the Global Times.Apart from this, not many delegates are not familiar with writing a proposal, said Wang.He added that delegates, new or experienced, need to be trained on how to properly prepare proposals.A total of 5,375 proposals and 462 bills were submitted this year at the two sessions, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
