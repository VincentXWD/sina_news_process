SAN FRANCISCO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco confirmed Tuesday that one Chinese passenger aboard the crash-landed Asiana Airlines remained in critical condition.Among the 141 Chinese passengers aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 241, a total of 12 people, including one in Intensive Care Unit, are still under treatment in local hospitals in San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday.The Boeing-777 of South Korea's Asiana Airlines broke off its tail and burst into flames after it veered off the runway upon landing at San Francisco International Airport Saturday morning.Two teenage girls from China died in the accident. Over 180 passengers have been hospitalized.According to preliminary findings of the crash by U.S. investigators, the plane was flying significantly slower than the target air speed of 137 knots before it smashed into a seawall in front of the runway.Information collected by the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder shows that a stall warning was triggered by the low speed four seconds before the crash, and the pilot asked to abort the landing 1.5 seconds prior to the impact but it was too late.
