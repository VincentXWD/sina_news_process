The pilot of the crash-landed Asiana Airlines plane told investigators he was “temporarily blinded” by a bright light shortly before touching the ground, a senior official was quoted as saying by USA Today.Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board investigating the crash, said the pilot was blinded when 500 feet above the ground. The comment was made during a daily press briefing on the Saturday crash that left two dead and over 160 injured.When asked specifically whether it could have been a laser pointed from the ground, Hersman said she had no answer at the moment."We need to understand exactly what that is," she said. "It was a temporary issue."(Agencies)
