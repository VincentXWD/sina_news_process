Over 80 passengers from Asiana Flight 214 have taken the first steps toward legal action against the airline, parts manufacturers and Boeing, manufacturer of the 777 jetliner, which crashed in San Francisco on July 6.Of the 307 passengers and crew, three died, and more than 180 were injured.Representing 83 victims, the Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered filed a petition for discovery in the Circuit Court of Cook County Monday, naming Boeing as the first defendant."Based on recent reports and on the ongoing investigation, it appears that the Asiana crash could have been caused by a mechanical malfunction of the auto-throttle," reads a statement the firm sent to the Global Times.The statement also said that some sliding ramps had deployed inside the plane and hampered passengers' safe exit, and seat belts had trapped people in the burning wreckage.Also Monday, a Korean mother and her 8-year-old son filed suit against Asiana, seeking compensation of $5 million. Both sustained injuries.Experts were surprised to hear of the legal actions before the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is complete, which could take a year, reported the Los Angeles Times.Wang Yukui, a spokesman of Boeing China, said there was no comment on the lawsuits, but added the NTSB is in charge of the investigation.There has been much recent speculation that Chinese passengers might receive lower compensation than those from other nations.Yang Jing, a marketing manager from Asiana, told the Global Times that such speculation is false. "The company is working on its compensation package, and the details may be revealed soon."In a media release sent to the Global Times, Floyd Wisner, expert in aviation law from the Chicago-based Wisner Law Firm, said that if pilot error is the cause, Chinese passengers will have to file suit at home, but the US-based passengers will recover "much greater amounts from a court in the US than will the other passengers in courts in (South) Korea or China."He also stated that people should not jump to conclusions as to the cause of the crash.An unnamed teacher from Jiangshan High School in Zhejiang Province said local authorities are discussing how to approach negotiations for the victims over compensation.Thirty-five teachers and students from the school were aboard the flight. Two students died at the scene, one allegedly killed by a fire truck, and another died of her injuries Friday."They will seek compensation in a group, not individually," he said. Negotiations between the victims and the airline have not kicked off.
