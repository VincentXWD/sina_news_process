A teenager victim of the Asiana flight 214, which crash landed in San Francisco almost two weeks ago, died of multiple injuries consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle, a local coroner said Friday.San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault told a news conference that the victim, a teenager girl from China, survived the crash landing of the Boeing 777-200 on July 6 and then was struck and killed by a fire vehicle rushing to the scene.The finding was based on internal hemorrhaging of the girl, he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said at the news conference that "it is very difficult and devastating news for all of us."Investigators believed the teenager was on the ground and not standing up when she was struck by at least one specialized fire- fighting vehicle deployed at San Francisco International Airport, Hayes-White said.Her body was discovered under a layer of fire-retardant foam that rescuers had sprayed on the plane to put out fire, the fire chief said.The victim was one of the two Chinese girls that were killed on the scene when the Asiana airliner crash landed at the airport. More than 180 others were also injured in the crash.A third girl, from the same school and on a summer school trip to the United States, died of multiple injuries on July 12.
