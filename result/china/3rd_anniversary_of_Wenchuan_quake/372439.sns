People took to the streets to express their gratitude for post-quake relief efforts during a street parade in Lixian county, southwest China's Sichuan province, May 8, 2011. More than 50,000 people in the county were affected by the 8.0-magnitude earthquake in Sichuan on May 12, 2008. They received massive aid from Hunan province that helped complete nearly 100 reconstruction projects with a 2 billion yuan ($308 m) investment.
