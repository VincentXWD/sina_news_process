BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China prepared itself for the worst when psychologists predicted a wave of suicides in the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which left more than 85,000 people dead or missing and millions without homes.However, China not only avoided a rash of suicides, but also managed to create new lives and futures for those affected by the quake.He Xiantong, a resident of Sichuan's Qingchuan County, lost 12 relatives during the May 12 earthquake. He says he thought of committing suicide not long after the disaster."My relatives were all buried under the rubble. I told myself that suicide was one option I could take. I was in too much pain to live," he says.What rekindled his hope to live on was a talk with local government officials. When he heard that a new park would be built in his hometown, he asked the county government for permission to open a new store in the park, a place where he could sell sacrificial offerings for visitors who wished to mourn relatives who were killed in the quake."They agreed to my proposal. While running my business, I have had chances to meet many people, and their love and kindness are infectious," he says.Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared on Tuesday that a "decisive victory" had been achieved in the reconstruction efforts, with 95 percent of reconstruction projects in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu having been completed.China's overall reconstruction plan called for the region to be completely rebuilt within three years. The government's main goal in executing the plan was to ensure security and stability for quake-affected residents by providing them with new employment and housing opportunities. Upgrading infrastructure, preserving the region's environment and bolstering local economies were also part of the ambitious plan.MODERN MIRACLEAnthony Redmond, director of the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute of the University of Manchester, stated that the post-quake reconstruction effort in Sichuan was one of the most efficient post-disaster reconstruction efforts ever seen.Redmond made the remarks at the First Interactive Seminar on Post-disaster Reconstruction and Sustainable Development, which opened on Wednesday in Sichuan's capital city of Chengdu.Having participated in medical relief work in Haiti after the country's own massive earthquake, Redmond attributed China's "almost inconceivable" efficiency to the government's leadership, saying that China's reconstruction effort was of "global exemplary significance."On May 26, 2008, two weeks after the earthquake occurred, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) decreed that 19 of China's provinces and regions would use 1 percent of their financial resources to support the reconstruction of the quake zone.This resulted in a rapid influx of capital, materials and experts from a variety of disaster-related fields. Rebuilding the quake-hit region was changed from a humanitarian project to a political task.Zhu Ziyu, deputy chief planner and director of the Urban Planning Research Department at the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, took charge of the design and reconstruction of Sichuan's Beichuan County.Recalling his experience with visiting experts from foreign countries during a United Nations development program, Zhu says that foreigners had reason to be astonished by the pace and quality of the reconstruction efforts.　[1]　[2]　[3]　[Next]
