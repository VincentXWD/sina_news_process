BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu has urged stepped-up efforts to cope with natural disasters in all phases such as monitoring, prevention, emergency relief and reconstruction."The people-oriented governance and the high frequency of various natural disasters have raised more requirements for our work on the prevention and relief of natural disasters," Hui said, adding that government departments must give "absolute priority" to the safety of people's lives.Hui made the remarks Thursday while presiding over a meeting on disaster prevention and reduction.May 12 is the nation's "Disaster Reduction Day" in memory of the devastating magnitude-8.0 earthquake that occurred in southwestern Sichuan Province on May 12, 2008.Hui called for high alerts on the heavy and continuous rainfall in many of the country's southern areas, urging local governments to take concrete measures to prevent mudslides and promote the ability for individuals to act independently while protecting themselves.Anticipating more arduous disaster relief missions in the next five years, Hui called for scientific planning, coordinated work between armies and government departments and strong policy support for the use of funds, material reserves and equipment arrangements, among other aspects.In addition, Hui urged efficient work on construction, material provision and transportation in several regions previously hit by disasters in order to finish the reconstruction missions there as soon and as well as possible.
