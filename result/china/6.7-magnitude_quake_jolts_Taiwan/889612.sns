TAIPEI, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the earthquake that struck southern Taiwan's Tainan city early Saturday had climbed to 67 by 9:48 p.m. Thursday, with 57 people still missing.The 16-storey Wei Guan building fell down toward a road on its east side seconds after the earthquake, according to an official update on the casualties.A total of 238 people were rescued out of the building, but 57 were still missing nearly six days after the quake.The quake, which the China Earthquake Administration said had a magnitude of 6.7, hit southern Taiwan at 3:57 a.m. Saturday, just two days ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year.Rescuers started searching efforts soon after the quake and are still working hard to dismantle the building and search for the missing, but more than three days has passed since the previous survivor was rescued.
