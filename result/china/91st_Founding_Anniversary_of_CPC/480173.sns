JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The great achievements made in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) are a contribution to human civilization, the South African Communist Party (SACP) told Xinhua here on Monday."As the 91st anniversary of the CPC on July 1 is coming, we are encouraged by the great achievements made in China ," SACP's Secretary for International Relations Chris Matlhako said in an interview with Xinhua at the SACP headquarters in Johannesburg."China's contributions to the world cover the political, economic, cultural and other fields in the human civilization due to the reform carried out by the CPC in the last 30 years," the secretary said."China is home to the world's largest population with a total number of 1.3 billion people. Now the Chinese people have lived a happy life due to dozens of years' reform, " said the secretary.He said he has a deep impression over China's great changes following his visiting China several times in the past years, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen.Matlhako praised China's new breakthrough made in the space exploration in the recent days, saying "the first Chinese female astronaut was sent into the orbit, producing the profound world meaning and influence, especially showing an excellent example for the women in the developing countries.""As the global second largest economic entity, China has significantly contributed to the formation of the world's multi- pole structure, which would benefit the world people, especially the people of the developing countries," he said.Matlhako also praised China's contribution to the IMF during the G20 summit last week. "The financial commitments to the IMF by China, South Africa and other three BRICS members at the G20 summit would help stabilize the global economy in coping with the Euro zone debt crisis."At the G20 summit, China promised to inject 43 billion U.S. dollars to the IMF, followed by Russia, Brazil and India with 10 billion U.S. dollars each, while South Africa offered 2 billion U. S. dollars.The SACP official said both communist parties of the two countries belong to the ruling parties with a long history, and had forged a deep friendship in the long-term national liberation movement against colonialism.The CPC was founded on July 1, 1921, while the SACP was established on July 31, 1921, currently being a membership in the ruling tripartite alliance in South Africa."After the democratic government was established in 1994 in South Africa, people have witnessed the better and better relationship between the two countries, which has promoted the development of the bilateral trade," the SACP official said.Matlhako believed China's African policy for trade is fostering the development on the African continent, especially in infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals and ports."China's trade policy with the African countries is based on the mutual benefit, namely win-win conception, which is widely welcomed by African people," he stressed.On China's future, the secretary predicted that China would become one of the world's largest economic entities. "As the great day is coming, China will make greater contributions to our human development."
