BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese mainland's quality authorities has stepped up its ban on imports of products from Taiwan that had been contaminated by an industrial chemical used to soften plastic products.In its latest update on the import ban posted on its website, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said the mainland would suspend imports of 812 kinds of products, including beverages, food products and food additives, made by 245 companies.On the blacklist, including asparagus juice made by the popular brand Uni-President, are also a number of children products such as nutrient branded Karihome made by Taiwan Direct Biological Technology Company.This is a much longer list than the original one issued by the AQSIQ on June 1, when the quality watchdog said the mainland would suspend imports of 22 kinds of beverages, food products and food additives from Taiwan that are produced by companies suspected of using bis (2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP).The food safety commission under the State Council, or cabinet, has also ordered increased inspections and instant recalls of beverages, food products and additives contaminated with DEHP.
