SHANGHAI, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- A local procuratorate in Shanghai Friday said it has brought criminal charges against three food company managers for producing and selling shoddy products in a dyed steam bun scandal.The three are the general manager, sales manager and production manager of Shanghai Shenglu Food Co., which added coloring while producing corn flour buns at a company subsidiary in Baoshan District, the district people's procuratorate said in a statement.The company sold over 270,000 packets of dyed buns worth 620,000 yuan (97,000 U.S. dollars) between October 2010 and April 2011, it alleged.The company also re-labelled buns made days earlier with new production dates and added expired or near-expired buns returned by retailers to the product mixes to create "new" buns.A deputy director of the food production supervision agency in Baoshan District was previously removed from his post for dereliction of duty related to the scandal, which emerged through a China Central Television (CCTV) report on April 11.
