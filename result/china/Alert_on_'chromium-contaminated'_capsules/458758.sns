Â By Monday noon, police in Xinchang had detained 11 people who allegedly produced and sold pharmaceutical capsules containing excessive levels of chromium. An investigative report from China Central Television revealed on Sunday that several companies in Xinchang, a major pharmaceutical production hub in China, had manufactured drug capsules with industrial gelatin, which contains a much greater amount of chromium than edible gelatin and is illegal to use for making drug capsules.
