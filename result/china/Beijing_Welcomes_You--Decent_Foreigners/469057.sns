By Sina EnglishA video about a Briton sexually harassing a Chinese woman in the street went viral, angering the Chinese public. Immediately afterwards, one netizen commented online, "do you think we are still in the time a century back when foreigners could do as they pleased on the Chinese soil?"With China going global, it is quite a common scene nowadays seeing foreigners jostling with us in the street and living next door or in the neighborhood. Megacities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are already “melting pot of different cultures.”Any coin has two sides, as the popular saying goes. The influx of foreigners is also immingled with the good and the bad.Criminal crimes involving foreign offenders have seen a stark rise in recent years, in particular, when it comes to those illegal aliens, referring to the foreigners enter China without a legal visa, the foreigners stay in China with an expired visa, and the foreigners have a job in China without a working permit.Some of them even commit crimes in China such as theft, fraudulence, smuggling and drug trafficking.The reason why these foreigners go so far as to run amuck in the Chinese society and even act wildly against the Chinese law is far too complicated to make a brief explanation.Perhaps, China's preferential policies in their favor have granted them a wrong mind picture of being superior and privileged to the local Chinese, which is, therefore, falsely interpreted by some as being treated lenient always by Chinese laws.But, what is noteworthy is the fact that China is, first and foremost, a country ruled by law, apart from the well-accepted reality that Chinese culture is hospitable to guests. “Isn’t it a great joy to have friends come from afar?” as quoted Confucius.During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the theme song “Beijing welcomes you” went resonating across the country. But to the foreigners like the above-mentioned Briton, Beijing would say unwelcome.As it happens, whether or not you are a popular guest and can win the due respect from the host will all depends upon your behaviors, and whether or not you wholly alienate or even hostile to the host.It is advisable to bear in mind: “Only good scouting is likely to preserve the respect and freedom so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout.”
