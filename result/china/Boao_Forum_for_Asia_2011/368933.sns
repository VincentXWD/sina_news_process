Hu Jintao　　President of the People's Republic of China　　At Opening Plenary of Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2011　　Boao, 15 April 2011Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,First of all, I wish to extend, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warm congratulations on the opening of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2011 and express sincere welcome to all guests present.The Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) was launched ten years ago with the concerted efforts of organizations and individuals from across Asia. It was an important symbol of the growing solidarity and desire for cooperation in Asia under the new situation. In the ten years since, the BFA has played an important role in building consensus in Asia, making Asia's voice heard and promoting Asian cooperation. It has become one of the highly influential economic forums in the world. The BFA owes its growth to the fast development of Asia; it is, at the same time, a witness and driver of this historical process.In the last ten years, Asia's economy has been in high gear and regional cooperation has seen robust growth. Asia's influence in the world has been rising steadily. Asian economy was the first to recover from the international financial crisis and has become an important engine for world economic recovery and growth. Asia's development is not only changing the destiny of the Asian people, but also exerting a growing impact on the development of the world.Reviewing the remarkable journey Asia has traveled, we can see that there are strong reasons behind Asia's profound transformation and outstanding achievements amidst a complicated and fluid international situation. Asia's development has benefited from a generally stable international and regional environment, the deepening economic globalization and regional cooperation, the good-neighborly relations in the region and more importantly, the commitment of the Asian people to carry forward the fine tradition developed in their time-honored history while drawing upon the good experience of other regions.-- The people of Asia have an unyielding spirit of seeking self-improvement. In their long history, the people of Asia have created a colorful and brilliant civilization that remains the envy of the world. However, in the modern era, due to internal and external factors, Asia experienced twists and turns in development. To change their destiny, the people of Asia have been forging ahead in an unyielding spirit and with hard work. Asia's development achievements today are the result of the persistent efforts of the industrious and talented Asian people.-- The people of Asia have an innovative spirit of breaking new ground. It has been proved by both history and reality that economic and social development is not possible without a development path suited to realities on the ground. The people of Asia know full well that there is no ready model or unchanging path of development that applies to all countries in the world. The people never shy away from reform and innovation. They are committed to exploring and finding development paths in keeping with the trend of the times and their own conditions, and have opened up bright prospects for economic and social development.　[1]　[2]　[3]　[4]　[Next]
