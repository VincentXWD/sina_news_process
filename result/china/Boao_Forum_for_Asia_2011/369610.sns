BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The recent speeches made by Chinese President Hu Jintao at the BRICS Leaders Meeting and Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) have garnered a lot of attention from the international community.The Chinese president chaired the BRICS Leaders Meeting in southern China's resort city of Sanya last Thursday, and gave a speech under the theme of "Broad Vision, Shared Prosperity."In his speech, he said that China has made remarkable achievements in its development over the past 30 years and more since its reform and opening-up.He said that, in the past decade, China imported 687 billion U.S. dollars of goods on average every year, creating over 14 million jobs in related countries and regions. This fully showed that China's development was part of the world development, and the better China developed, the greater the contribution it would make to the world.China's rise as an economic power is widely regarded as bringing prosperity to other developing countries in the region, said Fidel V. Ramos, former Philippine president and BFA chairman.Ramos said China is playing an increasingly important role in the economic growth of Asia and even the world at large.China's closer integration into the world economy will benefit East Asian economies such as South Korea, Singapore and Japan, Ramos said.Mkumbwa Ally, acting managing editor of Tanzania Standard Newspapers, said that Hu's remarks showed that China seeks not only its own development but also cooperation with other countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and America so as to achieve shared economic growth and prosperity.The Chinese president also delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 2011 BFA annual meeting on Friday. The theme of his speech was "Towards Common Development and a Harmonious Asia."During his speech, Hu briefed the participants about China's 12th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development, which lists the main tasks for the next five years.In the next five years, Hu said China will make great efforts to implement the strategy of boosting domestic demand, pursue the strategy of "going global," participate in global economic governance and regional cooperation, and build a resource-conserving and environment-friendly society.Former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that stimulating domestic consumption is a major element in the Chinese government's 12th Five-Year Plan, which has given full consideration to the country's economic security and the people's welfare.CHERISHING OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD A HARMONIOUS ASIAThe ten-year-old BFA has been an important force in building consensus in the region, promoting Asia's voice and boosting Asian cooperation.Over the decade, China has established various cooperative partnerships with almost all other Asian countries, and has become the largest trading partner and export market for many of them."China cannot achieve development and prosperity without Asia, and Asia needs China for development and prosperity," Chinese President Hu said in his speech at the opening ceremony of this year's forum.Ramos, one of the founders of the BFA, told Xinhua that the BFA is the first Asia-based international forum that aims to promote the Asian countries' interest through economic integration, transregional cooperation and cross-cultural interaction.This year's BFA forum was held under the theme of "Inclusive Development: Common Agenda and New Challenges."Noting that the people of Asia have a shared mission to promote common development and build a harmonious Asia, the Chinese president made a five-point proposal to achieve the goal, namely respecting the diversity of civilizations, transforming the development pattern, sharing development opportunities, seeking common ground while shelving differences, and championing mutual benefit.The Associated Press reported last Friday that through the proposal, the Chinese leader was calling for Asian nations to better cooperate in security matters in the region increasingly beset by rival territorial claims.Meanwhile, the Singaporean newspaper Lianhe Zaobao said Monday in an editorial that, as China is ready to adopt an open strategy that is more active in the coming five years to create and enhance benefits in Asia, it will also be committed to resolving disputes with its neighboring countries through peaceful means.Over the past decade, Asia has achieved rapid economic growth and flourishing regional cooperation, which Hu considered a result of the unyielding spirit of seeking self-improvement, the innovative spirit of breaking new ground, the open and inclusive spirit of learning from others, as well as the spirit of helping each other in difficult times -- all values shared by the Asian people.The four values named by the Chinese leader were hailed by media across the region such as the Indonesia-based International Daily News, which said all Asian countries should cherish the hard-won historic opportunities to promote cooperation and build a harmonious Asia.
