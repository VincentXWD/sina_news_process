SHANGHAI - Design flaws in the railway signal equipment led to Saturday's fatal high-speed train collision near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the Shanghai railway bureau said on Thursday.The crash in Wenzhou caused the deaths of at least 39 people and injured 192 others. Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday ordered a swift and transparent probe into Saturday's crash of two high-speed trains and asked that the result be made public.Wen, who made the remarks at a State Council executive meeting, offered his "deep sympathies" to victims and their families."Great importance must be attached to finding out the facts and judging the responsibility in accordance with laws and regulations," a statement released after the meeting said.The government would take "resolute steps to comprehensively strengthen safety", it said. The crash, and a string of public transport accidents, prompted the State Council to order "comprehensive and thorough inspections" on rail and road transport, bridges, coal mines and ongoing construction projects. Industries producing hazardous chemicals will also be inspected.Bridges, buildings and vehicles found to be in breach of safety standards must be closed or taken off the road until safety requirements are met, it said. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has joined the investigation of the Wenzhou crash.
