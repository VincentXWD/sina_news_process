The last survivor rescued from Saturday's deadly train crash in East China, two-year-old girl Xiang Weiyi, was said to be in a better condition on July 27, 2011. The girl, Xiang Weiyi, was rescued on Sunday, 21 hours after a bullet train barreled into the rear end of another bullet train that has stopped on the tracks in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province. Her parents were not so fortunate; both died in the crash.
