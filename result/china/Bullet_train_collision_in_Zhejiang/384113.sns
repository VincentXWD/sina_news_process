Premier Wen's powerful words prove reassuring

Grief, seriousness and a resolve to find the cause and punish the corrupt officials - if there are - responsible for the train collision in Wenzhou are what I saw at Premier Wen Jiabao's news conference held on Thursday at the wreckage site.Five days after at least 39 people, including three foreigners, were killed and 192 others injured in the train collision, which occurred on Saturday, the premier came to the crash site in Wenzhou.Wen spoke with crash victims' grieving relatives and delivered a brief address under a viaduct that four of the train carriages in the collision had fallen from. He also took some time to speak to reporters.Families of the victims, as well as the media, have been trying to talk with high-ranking officials in the hope of finding answers to some of the questions raised by the crash. Many have wondered why the official work to rescue the passengers on the trains had ceased before all of the survivors had been found."I have been sick recently and have spent 11 days on a sickbed," Wen, 69, said before he began taking questions. "My doctors allowed me to leave the hospital today. That's why I'm here five days after the accident happened."In the question-and-answer session, which lasted about an hour and a half, the premier was asked about how China can restore the international community's confidence in its high-speed rail technology, which it is trying to export, and whether he thinks the crash resulted from a natural disaster or human errors.Wen was very respectful to the more than 100 reporters present, many of whom had become drenched with sweat as they waited for him to arrive for nearly an hour and a half under the scorching sun. Wen himself proved resilient to the heat, twice declining offers of bottled water from nearby government workers.When a Japanese reporter asked a question in stumbling Chinese, the premier leaned his body to one side to make sure he heard every word clearly, nodding in the end to show he had understood.Standing in a line behind him were Lu Zushan, governor of Zhejiang province, Sheng Guangzu, railways minister, and various other high-ranking officials."His answers were largely satisfying," said Hayakawa Makoto, a correspondent for Kyodo News, after the conference.He said Japanese news outlets are mainly interested in learning the cause of the accident.The Ministry of Railways has pledged to disclose the results from a detailed investigation of the crash by mid-September."There were not many details about that provided at today's conference," the correspondent said. "We can understand that."Almost every journalist present on Thursday tried to ask the premier a question, raising their hands and even yelling at him to draw his attention.When Wen answered, though, everyone quieted down so they could hear his reply.The scene presented a contrast to a news conference given by Wang Yongping, the railways ministry's spokesman, a few days ago. There, some of Wang's comments about the accident and his answers to questions had been greeted with scoffs from the press corps."It's a miracle," Wang had said, commenting on how a 2-year-old survivor could have been found after emergency workers, according to reports, had been told to stop searching for anyone still alive amid the wreckage.Asked why parts from the wrecked train had been quickly buried at the site, Wang and other officials said that was done to clear a path for rescue equipment and not because they were trying to cover up the truth."Whether you believe it or not, I believe it," he said.Both comments have since been circulated widely online. Many writers have made fun of the spokesman's words in posts satirizing the way railway authorities responded to the accident.Wen's speech on Thursday, I think, should change some of this. Rather than continuing to mock official statements, the public is now more likely to remember the premier's powerful words and his pledge to find out the truth about the accident."This is not easy for him. Please show some understanding and sympathy for this elderly person," Qian Gang, director of the China media project at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Center, said on his micro blog.After the news conference, the public will feel emboldened to more ask questions about the accident, he added.
