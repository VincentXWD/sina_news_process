How the world media covered events in China three decades agoTo much of the world, China remained a mystery in the summer of 1981, when China Daily came into being.The country's economic reforms were just 3 years old, and the first group of students admitted through the college entrance exam, which had been reinstated in 1977, had graduated.The country was cautiously opening its doors again to the world, and the world was curious to peek inside. The Cold War, sanctions and distrust made China seem so different, and misinterpretation was common. But some visitors saw themselves as adventurous explorers in an alien environment. This is evident in the foreign press coverage of China in 1981, some of which we excerpt today.The scope of general interest in China was limited to lifestyles, customs and regulations, all of which were, quite literally, a world apart from the lives of many outside this country.Now, in 2011, China is more familiar to the outside world. As its influence continues to expand, the country no longer seems as mysterious and incomprehensible as it did 30 years ago.True, misunderstandings and rumors still abound. But the country's own voice, from growing indigenous outlets such as China Daily, has grown stronger, more confident and far-reaching.China today, by all measures, is not the China of 1981. The country has matured in its ability to communicate with the world around it. The history of China Daily itself bears testament to this shift.The selection of news coverage about China in 1981, in the paragraphs that follow, is not intended to merely raise a laugh. Granted, many of the items appear comical, if not bizarre, to today's young readers. But without this historic context it is impossible to understand how far China has come. History, as we all shall learn, should be respected, for people cannot make their history under conditions of their own choosing.It is in this spirit that China Daily, on the eve of its 30th anniversary, brings to readers the faces of a different China, when some of the country's best reporters and editors were called upon to create this newspaper.May history enlighten our work today and tomorrow, as the paper goes on to discover China's daily transformation in this changing world.'National pride has been growing' with the country since 1981, when the world saw mystery and quaintness in the People's Republic of China.
