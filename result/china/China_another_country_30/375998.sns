Chinese table tennis players and female gymnasts climbed to the top of the world in 1981.Reports from the West"In 1973, when they first came over here, they weren't very good," he (the legendary US gymnast Frank Cumiskey) said. "They had some guy who was about 35 who was their best gymnast, and he could not do a heckuva lot. And we beat their girls easily. Now they have girls 11 years old in international competition. They had about three of them compete against us."Cumiskey flatly predicts the Chinese women - or girls, as he explains - will sweep the next Olympics and the men will do well, too. "I see the Chinese women going 1-2-3 in everything . . . They will come up with kids we never heard of who will win."Jim Benagh's columnThe New York TimesJan 5, 1981In men's and women's singles, Americans were outclassed by players from China, which was competing in the event for the first time. The three men and two women representing China swept through the preliminary rounds, setting up all-Chinese finals."Chinese give table tennis lesson to the US"The New York TimesJune 22, 1981Current commentsWu Wenqiang, professor at Beijing Sport University: "Sports were least hit by the 'cultural revolution' (1966-76) and kept developing. China surprised the world in the early 1980s with its excellent performance in some sports, especially gymnastics and pingpong, since its athletes had been to few international contests for more than a decade."
