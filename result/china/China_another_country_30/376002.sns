Composer-performer Jean-Michel Jarre performed in Beijing as part of a China-France exchange project.Report from the WestAbout 15,000 people listened to the French composer of "Oxygene" and other best-selling albums, applauding occasionally but showing more interest in the spectacular lasers than in the eerily hypnotic music.The stadium was about 80 percent full when the concert started, but nearly half the audience left before the end - as happens at more conventional functions, because Peking's buses stop running at about 10 o'clock."China is exposed to laser rock"ReutersOct 22, 1981Current commentsWang Xiaofeng, music columnist: "China was hungry for all Western culture in 1981, either in form or in substance, and people were eager to know and obtain the essence of it, including the music.
