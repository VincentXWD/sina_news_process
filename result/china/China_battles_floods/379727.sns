Rainstorm triggered floods in Xincheng County of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, July 1, 2011, leaving the area seriously waterlogged. The trapped people are being evacuated and so far no one has been injured.  Downpours have fallen on the county since June 28, triggering floods which stranded more than 2,600 people in its 14 administrative villages. The floods also blocked roads leading out of the county. The local government has started a relief operation to transfer those in danger.
