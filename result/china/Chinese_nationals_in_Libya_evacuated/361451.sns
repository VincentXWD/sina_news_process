DHAKA, Feb 22, 2011 - Bangladesh said Tuesday that the Libyan ambassador to Dhaka had resigned, apparently in protest at the crackdown on anti-government protesters by Moamer Kadhafi's regime."We have received a note from the Libyan embassy that its ambassador Ahmed A.H. Elimam has resigned," Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary Mijarul Quayes told AFP.Elimam did not respond to calls from AFP on Tuesday and the Libyan embassy and staff at Bangladesh's foreign ministry said they did not know where he was.Fears also grew for the safety of around 50,000 Bangladeshis who work in Libya.Bangladeshi media reported Monday that some 100 Bangladeshis were being held hostage, possibly by armed anti-government protesters, in the Libyan port city of Darnah, east of Benghazi, since Friday.A hostage, named as Shafiuddin Bishwas, told bdnews24.com Monday that 30 to 40 armed people had been holding 300 foreign construction workers who were working for a South Korean construction firm.The hostages were taken to a mosque, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the camp where they were captured, Bishwas said, adding they were moved to community centres the following day.Foreign Secretary Quayes said the government had no confirmation of the reports, while Labour Minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain expressed concern about the "unofficial" information."Our priority is the safety and security of our Bangladeshi nationals in Libya," Quayes said.On Monday, some 500 Libyans looted a South Korean construction site west of Tripoli, injuring South Korean and Bangladeshi workers, Seoul's foreign ministry said.(Agencies)
