Chinese evacuees from Libya were seen aboard a Greek-flagged merchant ship "El. Venizelos" at southern Greek island of Crete, March 2, 2011.  The ship could be the last liner chartered by China's government to withdraw Chinese nationals from the turbulent North African country, according to the Chinese embassy in Greece and Greek officials.
