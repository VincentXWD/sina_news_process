GUANLEI, Yunnan, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese sailors returned home Sunday afternoon under the escort of a Chinese patrol ship after being stranded in northern Thailand following a cargo ship attack last week.A total of 11 cargo boats with 78 sailors on board began sailing into the Guanlei Port in the southwestern province of Yunnan at around 3:40 p.m.Out of safety concerns, 164 sailors had been living aboard 26 ships on the Mekong River in Chiang Saen since the attack.Twelve Chinese sailors were confirmed dead and one missing after two cargo ships, the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8, were attacked and hijacked by an unknown group of armed men on Oct. 5 on the Mekong River.The other 15 ships and 86 sailors are heading to the Guanlei Port and will arrive there later.The sailors left Chiang Saen for China Friday morning under the protection of patrol vessels dispatched by Yunnan's local police bureau.China also asked the governments of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar to protect the sailors and ships, ensuring them a safe trip home.China on Thursday demanded swift action from the three Southeastern Asian nations in preventing additional attacks on Chinese nationals on the Mekong River.Vice Foreign Minister Song Tao summoned diplomatic envoys from the three countries and urged the countries to intensify their investigations on the deadly attack.The Mekong River, known in China as the Lancang River, rises on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and flows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam before spilling into the South China Sea. It plays a crucial economic role throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
