CHIANG SAEN, Thailand, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- A working team dispatched by the Chinese government, accompanied by senior Thai police officers, inspected a section of Mekong River near Chiang Sean on Monday, as part of the probe into the killing of at least 12 Chinese sailors on the river earlier this month.The Chinese team, consisting of officials from Chinese ministries of foreign affairs, public security and transport, got aboard a speedboat provided by the Thai police to launch an inspection to the section of Mekong River where the abductors of the two ships were intercepted and then escaped.Twelve Chinese sailors on the two cargo ships were killed after being hijacked by unidentified armed people on Oct. 5 on Mekong River. One Chinese sailor is still missing. The Thai police had been proactively cooperating and supporting the work of the Chinese team and the Chinese Embassy would take further measures to properly handle problems arising from this incident, said Gao Zhenting, Counselor and Consul-General of the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.The Chinese team arrived in Chiang Sean in northern Thailand's Chiang Rai Province last Saturday and has been conducting joint investigation on the attacked ships with the Thai police.
