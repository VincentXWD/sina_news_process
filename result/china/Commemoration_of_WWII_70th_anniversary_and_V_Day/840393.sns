China's foreign ministry on Wednesday denied a Mainichi Shimbun report that Japanese Prime Miniter Shinzo Abe will visit China on September 3 but not to attend the parade, saying it "has never heard of" such things."We have never heard of Prime Minister Abe's visit to China in September," the ministry told the Global Times in a written reply on Wednesday morning.According to Japanese news outlet Mainichi, Abe will visit China on September 3, which coincides with China's military parade to mark its 70th anniversary of the victory of World War II. But the Japanese prime minister will not attend the parade."We would like to reiterate that China has invited leaders of relevant nations to the commemorative activities on September 3," the ministry added.Militaries of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the three former Soviet republics, reportedly will send troops to China to attend the military parade on September 3. The guard of honor company of the Belarusian army will join the parade with 85 "brave guys," reported Belarus-based media BelTA.Meanwhile, whether South Korean President Park Geun-hye will accept the invitation on celebrations on September 3 has not been confirmed, although the Korea Herald said in an editorial Tuesday that "it is now generally accepted that the president will visit China."
