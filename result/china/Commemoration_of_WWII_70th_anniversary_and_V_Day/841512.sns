Several Japanese-owned companies in China announced they will be giving a day off  to their employees to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, following mounting speculation those companies would not do so in light of rising Sino-Japanese tensions and the nature of the celebrations.China's State Council announced on May 13 that it has set September 3 as a national holiday celebrating the country's victory over Japan in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security also announced that those who are made to work during the holiday should be paid twice their daily wage.Chinese citizens expressed their curiosity on social media about whether Japanese companies in China will give their employees a holiday on the occasion which commemorates the war of resistance against Japan's wartime aggression.Employees at several Japanese companies confirmed to the Global Times that their companies will give them a day off in keeping with the Chinese government's announcement.Yamada, a Japanese employee from a Japanese trading company in Shanghai, said she plans to take a trip during the holiday. Asked if she felt awkward about the holiday, she said she treats it like any other holiday.Toyota Motors China also told the Global Times that the company will abide by China's policies and respect Chinese customers' feelings.However, All Nippon Airways said it would be business as usual because of the nature of its business. Xiao Bai (pseudonym), a company employee, said "Why can't we also enjoy the holidays? Japanese companies should also comply with [China's] rules."A Japanese executive at a medical company said on condition of anonymity that he personally supports the holiday and thinks it shows respect to the Chinese government and people.The new holiday has led to a demand for vacation trips, and many tour agents have started promoting destinations related to the war, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.Â
