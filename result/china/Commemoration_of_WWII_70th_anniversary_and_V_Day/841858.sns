Japanese leader’s decision symbolizes ‘regression,’ say observersJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision to skip an upcoming military parade in Beijing, which marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, has proven Japan's "regression in its approach toward history," said observers.Japan's top government spokesman said Monday that Abe will not visit China to attend the upcoming ceremony on September 3, when China will hold a military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) and world anti-Fascist war.Abe does not plan to make a trip around that time either, said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga at a press conference, reported Kyodo News.Suga said that Abe decided to skip the visit because of his parliamentary schedule, which refers to debates over the controversial security bill. But analysts said Abe's recent move has reflected the Japanese government's complicated historical view that is in stark contrast to Germany, which takes responsibility for its actions as an aggressor in WWII."The two countries have demonstrated very different understanding and approach toward history. Germany has made successful transition from its previous aggression," Liu Jiangyong, vice director of the Modern International Relations Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times.In contrast, the current Japanese leader has deviated from the correct historical view of his predecessors, as Abe has "retaken its historical burden," said Liu.German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May skipped Russia's Victory Day parade, but instead joined Russian President Vladimir Putin at a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate the Russians killed during WWII.In his speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII on August 14, Abe said he upheld past government apologies for Japan's wartime past, but stopped short of directly admitting Japan's wartime aggression.Earlier this month, Abe told public broadcaster NHK that he would only attend commemorative events that were conciliatory and not "anti-Japanese.""We would like to continue making use of opportunities including international conferences for the leaders to hold a frank dialogue toward fostering better bilateral ties," Suga said, adding China has already been informed that Abe cannot attend the ceremony, Kyodo reported.Sino-Japanese relations have long been shadowed by differences in views toward wartime history. The two countries also have disputes over islands in the East China Sea.Geng Xin, deputy director of Tokyo-based think tank New Japanese Institute, said that Abe's decision signals that the Japanese leader is following the US in opting not to join the campaign.However, Geng added that the overall direction of the two countries' relations will continue to move in a promising direction, especially following the ice-breaking meeting between Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in November 2014.
