CHINESE President Xi Jinping signed a prisoner amnesty at the weekend as part of commemorations marking the end of World War II. It could see thousands of inmates, including war veterans and juveniles, released.After a weeklong discussion, the top legislature adopted the amnesty deal on Saturday, granting official pardons to thousands of convicted war veterans as well as young people and elderly prisoners meeting certain criteria.The deal comes 40 years after a Chinese amnesty for war criminals in 1975.Prisoners who fought in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the civil war in the 1930s and 1940s are all now at least 80 years old. The group is very small and deemed not to pose a threat to society at such an advanced age.The mercy shown to veterans is an apt recognition of their contributions in the wars, and it shows China’s attitude to history and commitment to peace. While China remembers the fallen, jailed allies can not be forgotten despite their post-war missteps, the government said.Criminals aged 75 or above, and those with physical disabilities who are unable to care for themselves, will be released and provided with special care ahead of the anniversary celebrations.Those who committed their crimes while under the age of 18 and who received a prison term less than three years will also be freed.The amnesty is said to be in line with China’s Criminal Law, which was amended in 2011 to allow leniency in the punishment of the aged.The amnesty will be the eighth to be granted by the People’s Republic of China since it was founded in 1949.However, authorities said that the selection of criminals for amnesty will be strict and prudent. The latest pardon is designed to exclude officials convicted of embezzlement and bribe-taking, criminals said to be widely resented by the public.It is also not applicable to those guilty of murder, rape, terrorism and mafia-style acts, which are deemed the most serious crimes and their perpetrators most likely to threaten public safety and social stability.The amnesty takes full account of political security, people’s safety, public opinion and the nation’s fight against corruption, officials said.However, those qualifying for a pardon can’t be set free until the courts review their cases and pronounce verdicts. Prosecutors will supervise the process and the police will enforce order.After the amnesty, the government said it will continue to manage the ex-convicts and help them integrate into normal life.
