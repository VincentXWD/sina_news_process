Due to lack of food and an outbreak of epidemic, 20,000 people starved to death.He said he raped a total of 30 "comfort women"-- wartime forced sexual slaves, including Chinese and Korean, from September 1940 to May 1945.Born in Japan in 1922, Sibayama joined the the Japanese invasion in 1940 and was captured in August 1945.His confession is the 26th in a series of written statements by Japanese war criminals published on the SAA website in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII.
