Govt needs sustained efforts to preserve ‘Parade Blue’Beijing's air quality deteriorated on Friday after 15 consecutive days of what Chinese netizens refer to as "Parade Blue," or blue skies, sparking public concern of how to sustain clean air beyond special events.The capital's air quality index (AQI) soared to 407 on Friday, with PM10 particles largely to blame for poor air quality, media reported.The density of PM2.5 particles - another key indicator of air quality - had remained "excellent" for a record-breaking 15 consecutive days since August 20, with its AQI at less than 50. It was also the day a citywide ban began on vehicles for the military parade on September 3.Neighboring provincial regions, including Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, also launched a campaign from August 28 to September 4 to safeguard "Parade Blue," a plan aimed at reducing by 40 percent emissions of major pollutants, news portal thepaper.cn reported.Coal-fired power plants in these regions have been ordered to either suspend operations or reduce work to cut emissions. Nearly 10,000 factories were affected by pollution control measures and works at some 9,000 construction sites were suspended, said the report.Those measures saw a marked improvement in Beijing's air quality, with the AQI remaining excellent for half a month."Efforts against air pollution are not just meant for one specific event or conference, but at improving people's living standards and environment. If the government is consistent with such efforts, the 'Parade Blue' will be permanent," Yu Jianhua, chief engineer of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told Science and Technology Daily."More measures to ensure a permanent blue sky will be implemented and short-term fixes will be reduced," said Chai Fahe, vice president of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES)."The most significant message of 'Parade Blue' is how much our economy can handle environment protection," wrote Li Zhiqing, a deputy director at the Center for Environmental Economics Studies of Fudan University, in a commentary on thepaper.cn published on Saturday.Businesses usually favor small investments with instant and short-term returns, while constantly improving their facilities is considered time-consuming and risky, Zhang Xiaobo, a Beijing-based expert on carbon emissions, told the Global Times. "Therefore, government support is necessary."Provinces such as Shanxi have been using carbon emissions as a way to assess government performance on pollution control, Zhang said.Li added that the "Parade Blue" can become a benchmark for future measures on air pollution control, as he calls for a system to assess local governments' efforts against pollution."It should be noted that clear skies cannot be sustained with short-term efforts. People also need to be informed on how they can help curb pollution," said Zhao Zhangyuan, a professor at the CRAES.
