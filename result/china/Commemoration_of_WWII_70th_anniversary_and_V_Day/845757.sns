The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday rejected the remarks of the Philippine Defense Department spokesperson, warning that those remarks confuse right and wrong and are not worth any comment.The Philippine Spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday that the Department welcomes the Chinese leadership's recent pronouncement that they are committed to peace, but questions China's display of offensive weaponry."China's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War and its announcement of cutting the number of troops by 300,000 highlight China's sincerity for peace as well as its determination to uphold peace," Hong said."The international community speaks highly of China's sacrifices as the main theater in the East of the World Anti-Fascist War and its firm attitude to defend world peace," the spokesman added."The Philippine side made such kind of remarks in total disregard of China's resolve and commitment, confusing right and wrong and misleading the public. It is not worth any comment," Hong said.
