Every month, Lu Caiwen makes a pilgrimage to the National Cemetery in Tengchong, Yunnan Province to mourn his fallen comrades who were laid to rest decades ago.Lu, 89, a veteran of the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF), recently returned to Tengchong from Beijing after representing veterans in the epic military parade held in Tiananmen Square on September 3.In 1942, China established the CEF to support British troops in their fight against the Japanese invaders and to safeguard China's southwest regions during World War II.These soldiers, together with American, British, Burmese and Indian troops, fought together against Japanese forces in the China-Burma-India road. Some 100,000 CEF soldiers died in Myanmar during the war.More than 3,000 soldiers from the CEF are buried in the National Cemetery, built in 1945, with more remains being interred occasionally. The remains of 19 CEF soldiers were collected in Myanmar and escorted to the cemetery in September 2011 and the ashes of more than 600 deceased soldiers were brought to the cemetery in June 2014.The remains of a large number of CEF soldiers are still in Myanmar.Lu and many other veterans have long hoped that the remains of their comrades that were buried overseas could be brought back to China."They fought for our country and there was no reason for us to leave their remains alone in other countries," Lu said.A tough taskThis year marked the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII and Tengchong, a border town in Southwest China saw some of the bloodiest battles between the CEF and the Japanese. The town this year held a series of activities to commemorate the battles, an official from Tengchong surnamed Zhang told the Global Times.One part of this commemoration is to repatriate the remains of soldiers who were buried near the Yunnan-Myanmar border and to inter them in the National Cemetery, said Zhang.The remains of more than 600 soldiers who died on the Myanmar side of the border were cremated according to local customs and the ashes were collected in 24 urns. The urns were brought to China and buried in the cemetery in June 2014.It is not easy to collect the remains of these soldiers because they were often buried hastily and some parts of their bodies have been lost with the passage of time, Li Hong (pseudonym), a staff member from the cemetery told the Global Times."The work to bring back the remains of the CEF soldiers should be accelerated. Some tombs were damaged by local residents during the 1950s and 1960s when disputes arouse between Myanmar and China and the humid weather in this area is not good for preserving the remains," said Li.More needs to be doneBringing the remains of the soldiers home calls for the joint efforts of different government departments as well as civil society, Yang Suhong, head of the cemetery told the Global Times.United front work departments at various levels in Yunnan are now taking on the responsibility for bringing the remains of CEF soldiers back home, said Yang.Thanks to the help of overseas Chinese organizations in Myanmar and domestic charities, Tengchong's United Front Work Department was able to bring the 24 urns of ashes of deceased soldiers back to China and hold a public memorial ceremony, according to the department.But most of the money to do the work was raised privately in the past since the CEF soldiers belonged to the Kuomintang army, said a tour guide surnamed Huang from a WWII battlefield in Laifeng Mountain, Tengchong that is now a memorial site.The Shenzhen-based Longyue Charity Foundation has been dedicated to tracking down CEF remains and bringing them back to China since 2001 and has raised more than 2 million yuan ($322,600) to fund its projects.The Longyue foundation has also sent an excavation team, led by archaeologists from Shaanxi-based Northwest University to discover remains and other items from the war in Myanmar."Instead of relying on civil society, whose strength is limited, the government should take more responsibility to bring our heroes back. For example, it could negotiate with the Myanmar government about the possibility of re-establishing graveyards and building monuments in Myanmar in places where the soldiers were buried before," said Huang.
