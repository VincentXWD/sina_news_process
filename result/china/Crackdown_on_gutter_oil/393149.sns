BEIJING, Aug. 31 (Xinhua) -- China's food safety watchdog on Wednesday issued new regulations for food safety management in restaurants, snack bars and company and school cafeterias, with special requirements for waste food treatment and food additives.Catering service workers are required to examine their health conditions each working morning, and mechanisms for waste food treatment and food safety incident prevention will be established to control risks, said Chen Xu, an official of the State Food and Drug Administration.Additives used in seasonings and beverages must be reported to food safety supervisors and published in dining halls or on menus, Chen said.Food safety has long been a concern in China.Authorities have arrested 989 people over the last six months as part of a national crackdown on the manufacture and sale of clenbuterol, an illegal fat-burning drug that is sometimes used as an additive in pig feed, a public security official said Monday.
