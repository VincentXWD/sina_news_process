BEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- A cold front will hit multiple regions in China next week, bringing rain, high winds and snow, national meteorological authorities said during a Thursday press conference.Snow is expected to sweep north China, as well as areas south of the Yellow and Huaihe rivers, from Dec. 4 to 8, while rain will hit several areas in south China, according to Chen Zhenlin, a spokesman for the China Meteorological Administration.Three waves of cold air will move through China over the next ten days, dragging temperatures down by 6 to 8 degrees Celsius in central and east China. The week after next is expected to see colder temperatures than were recorded during the same period last year, Chen said.Meteorological experts said people living in the affected regions should bundle up to guard against low temperatures.Fog and haze, which are more likely to blanket central and east China in December than in other months, will decrease visibility and amplify the effects of air pollution, experts said.
