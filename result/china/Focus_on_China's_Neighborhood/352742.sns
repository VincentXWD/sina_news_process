A manuscript of Haiguoji, or Records of Maritime Nations, which offers a further proof that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China, is set to be auctioned in Beijing Monday, Shanxi Evening News reported. But the auction organizers said that non-Chinese nationals will not be allowed to bid as "it concerns territorial sovereignty."The copy of Haiguoji was written by Qian Yong of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and it is considered one of the lost parts of Six Chapters of A Floating Life, an autobiographical novel written by Shen Fu during the Qing Dynasty, which has records showing that China owns the territorial sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands.The last two chapters of Six Chapters of A Floating Life were lost over the centuries. However, earlier this year, an antique collector called Peng Ling from North China's Shanxi Province bought a manuscript called Jishizhu written by Qian Yong, in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, and scholars determined that the manuscript contains the lost fifth chapter of Haiguoji.Fu Xuancong, a member of the CPC Central Research Institute of Culture and History, and Ken-Hsiang Tsai, a professor with National Kaohsiung Normal University in Taiwan, both published articles saying that Haiguoji is a part of Six Chapters of A Floating Life.
