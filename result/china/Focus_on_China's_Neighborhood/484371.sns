By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishAround 200 protesters marched along streets in Hanoi and came within 300 feet of the Chinese embassy on Sunday, the second anti-China rally this month amid tensions with China over disputes of South China Sea islands.Protesters reportedly waved banners and chanted slogans like "Paracels - Vietnam, Spratlys - Vietnam", referring to Chinaâ€™s Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands respectively.Relations between Beijing and Hanoi have deteriorated dramatically amid renewed provocations from Vietnam.Last month, Hanoi passed legislation putting some islets in the South China Sea under jurisdiction of Vietnam.Last month, China created a new Sansha city to administer the island groups of Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha and surrounding waters.In addition, state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation also called for foreign bidding to cooperate in oil exploration in the South China Sea.
