By Li Hongmei, Special to Sina EnglishIn a blurred political world, there might be no “what is truth,” but there must be “what stands me in good stead.” That explains why politicians tend to set their goal the ones not necessarily lofty, but definitely gainful.Philippine President Aquino III never hesitated and never minced words when expressing his gratitude to China yesterday for its financial assistance in the construction of a water supply project in the country’s capital region.Aquino led the inauguration of the second phase of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System’s (MWSS) Angat Water Utilization and Aquedact Improvement Project at the La Mesa Dam Portal in Quezon City. The project was built through the Preferential Buyer’s Credit of China Export-Import Bank.The President said the project aims to increase the number of households served with clean potable water and prevent the unabated loss of this valuable source due to leaks.“We thank China for the fund that you have extended to complete this important project,” he said.Chinese Ambassador to Manila Ma Keqing was also present during the launching of the project, which was finished eight months ahead of schedule.In the opposite scenario, the months-long stand-off with China is far from over, and Manila’s hawkish diplomats and politicians have all along playing up the South China Sea disputes.With China’s aid in hand, Manila is now greeting the U.S. Pacific Command commander Admiral Samuel Locklear, whose visit is highly touted as a move to reaffirm Washington’s long standing partnership with the Philippines, and a commitment of the US government to help build a minimum credible defense posture to counteract China.Thus far, it is too early to conclude whether Manila could take some pleasure from playing both sides of coin, and finally benefit from the game. Hopefully, the Philippine side could keep the flames at bay and have the knowledge of where to halt. As to the U.S. support in return for its military presence there, the Philippine side is supposed to be wise enough not to quench a thirst with real poison.Related news:US commander visits Philippines amid South China Sea tensionUS commander visits Philippines amid South China Sea tensionPhilippine palace spokesman tells China to 'be careful' in MandarinPhilippines: Chinese ships playing ‘hide and seek’ in Huangyan IslandAquino orders Philippine ships away from Huangyan IslandPhilippines, US kick off 9-day joint naval exercises
