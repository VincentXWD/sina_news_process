By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishThe Tokyo metropolitan government on Friday ran an ad in U.S. newspaper The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), seeking support for its farce to buy Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.Covering two-thirds of a page and titled "To the American People from Tokyo, Japan," the ad reads, "It is with the hope of gaining the understanding and support of the American people for our purchase of the Senkaku Islands (Chinese Diaoyu Islands) that we are running this issue advocacy ad today."Stating that Diaoyu Islands are “of indispensable geostrategic importance to U.S. force projection," the ad also warned that "failure to support the Asian nations confronting China would result in the United States losing the entire Pacific Ocean."Japan's promotion is clearly aimed at drawing the US involved in the territorial disputes with China and making it look like an international issue that Washington can not possibly look on.Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara announced Tokyo's plan to purchase the uninhabited but potentially resource-rich islands in April. Tensions have risen in recent months as Japanese conservative activists and politicians continue enraging China with irresponsible comments and  provocative actions.China’s flagship newspaper the People’s Daily on July 27 published an editorial on its overseas edition, warning the U.S. to stay out of maritime disputes in the region, otherwise “it would plunge into the abyss of South China Sea and East China Sea as it just extricated itself from the Middle East Desert”.Related news:China expresses "grave concern" over Japanese PM's remarks on Diaoyu IslandsJapan's PM: Mobilize SDF for Diaoyus if necessaryChina and Japan to build maritime liaisonMemorial on Diaoyu Islands, Japan further to poison ties with ChinaJapan's FM: US confirms Diaoyu Islands under US-Japan TreatyJapan's defense chief supports Tokyo's landingJapanese government delays landing plan on DiaoyuMedia buzz: Japanese ambassador to go or stay?Japan: recalling ambassador not a protest to ChinaChina "strongly dissatisfied" with Japan on Diaoyu Islands: spokesman"Buying-Islands" farce to badly damage hard-won China-Japan relations
