By Ma Qian,Sina EnglishThe Asia-Pacific region has been spoiled by competing territorial claims and continuous provocations from some countries. Growing conflicts have thus rendered the regional security situation more turbulent. Taking account of the current circumstances, experts pointed that the Asia-Pacific turmoil would bring China an optimal timing to build up its military strength.The turmoil, in the first place, provides China with a sensible justification to further reinforce its military strength. Since the reform and opening-up, China has grown up to be a leading economic power. In stark contrast, its military strength has followed a sluggish development, some fields of which even lagging behind the neighboring countries.However, in recent years, the government has coordinated military progress with the economic achievements by adjusting its development policies. This, however, jitters quite a few countries, some even hyping up the so-called "China threat", and struggling in a desperate attempt to contain China's military development.In the meantime, China’s neighboring countries have increased investment in military build-up. Some, with growing military ambition, have been encroaching on China’s legitimate rights and interests little by little, thus posing a serious threat to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.China has been committed to safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as the country in itself is on the path to building a harmonious world. Therefore, a strong army might well be in a real need at such a time.Moreover, the regional turmoil may offer China an opportunity to recalibrate its national strength in the framework of the regional pattern.Furthermore, China ought to be more proactive in removing discord with neighboring countries. Regional chaos, in turn, could also drive nations at variance to be in touch with each other. Countries involved in disputes could also have the chance to compare the national strength of each other, which acts as a prop-up of the settlement of international issues.From such perspectives, China is not afraid of regional chaos. Instead, China is advisable to seize the chance provided by the chaos, promoting the settlement of disputes and conflicts with its neighbors.Related news:Who is playing “divisive diplomacy” in South China Sea？ China appreciates a united ASEANCommentary: U.S. needs to behave itself over South China SeaChina strongly opposes U.S. State Department's statement on South China SeaChina FM calls for further cooperation with MalaysiaChinese FM meets Brunei crown prince on tiesIndonesian president, Chinese FM discuss bilateral tiesChina FM calls for further cooperation with MalaysiaU.S. senator butts in China's affairs over islandsUndue demands prevent ASEAN meeting from issuing joint communique: Cambodian FMPhilippines and Vietnam to "internationalize" disputes with ChinaSansha established, Vietnam and Philippines frownedPLA to garrison in Sansha City
