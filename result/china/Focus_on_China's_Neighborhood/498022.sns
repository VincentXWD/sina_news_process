Singh told the Lok Sabha in a written reply earlier this week.He said that block 128 and production block 6.1 fell under disputed zones.State-run OVL had halted its exploration activities in block 128 last year after China issued a demarche stating that its permission must be sought for exploration in block 127 and 128. The company was planning to quit the project. However, Vietnam later extended its exploration contract with OVL.The minister said OVL was associated with eight exploration blocks as an operator and seven blocks as non-operator under various production sharing contracts.He also said that OVL had 10 oil and gas assets in eight countries and produced 8.753 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas.Related news:India to take the Vietnam’s bait for South China Sea oilVietnam has decided to extend the contract for exploration in a crucial oil bloc in South China Sea to an Indian company attempting to hold on to Indian presence in the resource-rich region, the Press Trust of India reported on July 15.Vietnam holds on to India in South China Sea oil blockVietnam has decided to extend the contract for exploration in a crucial oil bloc in South China Sea to an Indian company attempting to hold on to Indian presence in the resource-rich region, the Press Trust of India reported on July 15.
