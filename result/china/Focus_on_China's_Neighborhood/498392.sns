By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishSome Philippine activists have called on the fellow countrymen all over the world to join "the global day of prayer for peace in the Scarborough Shoal" (Chinese Huangyan Island) slated for August 21, local media reported on Monday.The Inquirer said over 300 cities and towns in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia and the Philippines have signed up to participate in worship Tuesday to pray for a peaceful resolution of the Philippines’ territorial dispute with China and to call for a boycott of China-made products as a non-violent protest against China’s "creeping invasion" of the Philippines.According to the ABS-CBN, Loida Nicolas Lewis, chairperson of US Pinoys for Good Governance and also organizer of the event, said at a press conference that if China has the power of enormous warship, the Philippines in turn has the power of worship and asked the help of media to drum up support for his cause."In his State of the Nation Address on July 23, President Aquino asked for solidarity from the Filipino people and on August 21, we will, with one voice, express our solidarity with the Filipino people and tell China to leave the Scarborough Shoal," a spokesman of the organizer was quoted as saying.The group also announced that on August 21, a press conference will be held at the Rockwell Tent in Makati, which is said to be attended by more than 200 church leaders of all faiths as well as top political and business leaders.As China is currently locked into an island dispute with Japan, the Philippines picks the perfect timing to distract China again.The maritime tension over Huangyan Island has deescalated recently with Manila pledged no more provocations to China.So, if the activists are really praying for peace, why they design the plot to boycott Chinese products? Will the boycott, even if it could take effect, spell a loss for Chinese businesses? Will it backfire?
