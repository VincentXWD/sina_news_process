By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishWall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the U.S. is planning a major expansion of missile defenses in Asia in a move meant to contain threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and also to counter China's military development.As part of strategy of pivot to Asia, Washingtonâ€™s planned buildup includes a new radar in southern Japan and possibly another in Southeast Asia tied to missile-defense ships and land-based interceptors.China's Ministry of National Defense didn't comment directly on the anti-missile plans, but sounded a cautious note."China has always believed that anti-missile issues should be handled with great discretion, from the perspective of protecting global strategic stability and promoting strategic mutual trust among all countries," China said in a statement on Thursday."We advocate that all parties fully respect and be mindful of the security concerns of one another and try to realize overall safety through mutual benefit and win-win efforts, while avoiding the situation in which one country tries to let its own state security take priority over other countries' national security."Related news:U.S., Gulf allies pursue missile shield against IranUS missile shield, pointed message to IranU.S., Gulf allies pursue missile shield against IranU.S. to boost missile defense in Gulf: spokesmanUS building missile defense radar in Qatar
