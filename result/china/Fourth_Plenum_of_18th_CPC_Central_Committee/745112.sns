BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- A key Chinese political meeting to be held in late October will take "rule of law" as its central theme, showing the Communist Party of China's (CPC) striving for a complete legal system.The fourth plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, slated for Oct. 20-23, will be a milestone in the Chinese history of running state affairs under the rule of law.This being the first time that a plenary session of the CPC Central Committee has taken rule of law as its key topic, it will see the CPC enrich socialist legal theories and come out with concrete measures.Efforts will be made in promoting the rule of law, governing by law and administration by law, so as to ensure scientific legislation, strict enforcement, judicial justice and promote modern governance.In 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee established the reform and opening-up policy and called for an improved socialist legal system, laying the foundation stone for rule of law.After nearly 20 years of economic and social development, the CPC wrote "to build a socialist country under the rule of law" into its national report and regarded it as a fundamental strategy for governing the nation.Last year, the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee further updated its legal practice and reiterated "to rule, be in power and administrate state affairs according to law."The upcoming fourth plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee will involve further study on "rule of law" and see concrete management measures stipulated.As its society and economy have developed, China has entered a stage in which it badly needs deepened reform. The fact that the overhaul will touch the vital part of the present interest chain means that rule of law is required more than ever.Last year, the CPC leadership launched the "mass-line" campaign to clean up undesirable work styles such as formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance.In accordance with laws, a large number of Party members and officials have been implicated with many punished through means including dismissal, demotion or faced judicial examination since the campaign was launched.In order to build a complete legal system, the campaign still needs more efforts in efficient enforcement and close supervision.The CPC should also effectively improve law enforcement in government administration to ensure that laws are enforced in a standard, fair and civil manner.Stricter supervision should be imposed on law enforcers in order to avoid power abuse, and those who ignore legal restraint should be punished.(To stay up to date with the latest China news, follow XHNews on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/XHNews and Xinhua News Agency on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency.)
