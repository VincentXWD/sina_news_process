The 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convenes its fourth plenary session on Monday amid high expectations from the entire nation. The rule of law is believed to be a key topic on the agenda.In 1997, the concept of the rule of law was written into the report of the 15th National Congress of the CPC for the first time. It was later clearly stipulated in the Constitution in 1999. Over the last more than one decade, China has achieved a great many results in building the rule of law, and the concept has become known to all Chinese.The rule of law is more than a national policy. It is an indication of capability and an all-round update of the system of governance. China is among the latecomers in modernization. Therefore, decision-makers should have a firm determination to promote the concept, from legislation, and education to law enforcement.Despite constant strides, China has endured much criticism and undergone many public crises in this regard. Nonetheless, those sufferings have converted into the driving force of the rule of law, thanks to the efforts of many social forces.Radical voices in the past emerged over constructing the rule of law, which discloses discontent toward the system. However, society under the leadership of the Party is making great efforts in building the rule of law. It is different from a dozen years ago.China's legislation in the legal system has taken initial shape. Education in the law through publicity and the handling of a series of public incidents has seeped into society. That all people are equal before the law is no longer an ideal or a slogan, but the demand of mainstream public opinion in China.People from all walks of life have reached an unprecedented consensus on the rule of law. More emphasis has been put on the restraint of power.Officials have also taken the initiative to explore how to ensure the Party can lead the country under the rule of law.Statements like "the rule of law is the basic resort for governing the country," and "Party organizations at all levels should conduct activities within the framework of the Constitution and other laws" can be found in official documents and leaders' speeches, signaling that the construction of the rule of law is stepping into a new era.The imperfect legal system has been a target of strong criticism, intensifying conflicts and contradictions.However, as shown in the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC, the mainstream of Chinese society has never ceased putting forward the rule of law over the past decades.Democracy and the rule of law cannot be fulfilled in a "Great Leap Forward" way. We must build them step-by-step.
