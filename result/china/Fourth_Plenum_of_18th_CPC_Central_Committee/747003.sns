2014-10-20 08:26:00 GMT
The Communist Party of China (CPC) is a great Marxist political party. It is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, and the leading core of the Chinese people of all nationalities. Since its founding in 1921, the CPC has traveled a glorious path of struggle for the liberation of China and the happiness of the people, as well as the progressive cause of mankind.For eighty-one years, the CPC has led the Chinese people through hard and tortuous struggles which gained the great victory of the new democratic revolution, the socialist transformation and the socialist construction. For eighty-one years, the Party has combined the universal truths of the Marxism-Leninism with the practical situation of the Chinese revolution and construction. For eighty-one years, the Party has continuously strengthened itself by summing up experience and correcting its own mistakes.Modern Chinese history well indicates that without the Communist Party, there would have been no New China. Neither would there be China's socialism. Only with the leadership of the Communist Party of China can there be victory of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. Only with the leadership of the Party can the Chinese people have a brighter and more hopeful future.The Nature and Guiding IdeologyThe Communist Party of China (CPC) is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the faithful representative of the interests of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and the core of leadership of the Chinese socialist cause.After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the CPC became the ruling party, leading the country in its political life and social activities. The leadership of the CPC over state affairs focuses on political principles, political orientation, decision making on major issues and makes recommendations regarding the appointment of important officials to government bodies. Within the system of the state leadership, the CPC cannot replace the functions and powers of the bodies of state power. What are subject to the discretion of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee should be submitted as Party's proposals or submitted through government to the NPC and its Standing Committee for a decision according to the law. In this way the Party's propositions are changed into the state will and become the codes of conduct to be observed by the whole society. The Party has to act within the scope of the Constitution and laws, guaranteeing that the legislative, judicial and administrative departments of the state as well as economic, cultural and mass organizations work in an active, independent, responsible and coordinated manner.Guide in ActionThe CPC uses Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guidance in its action. Since its inception, the Party has considered Marxism and Leninism as its guiding ideology. During the long-term revolutionary struggle, the CPC members represented by Mao Zedong integrated the general theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution and founded Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China. It is proven in practice to be the correct theoretic principles and summary of experience concerning China's revolution and construction. It is a product of the collective wisdom of the CPC. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee which was held at the end of 1978, the CPC represented by Deng Xiaoping, summing up both positive and negative experience accumulated since the founding of the Republic and following the principle of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, shifted the focus of work to economic construction and introduced the policies of reform and opening to the outside world, bringing China into a new period of socialist construction. During the process, lines, principles and policies of building socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually took shape and basic issues in respect of building, consolidating and developing socialism in China were clarified. As a result, the Deng Xiaoping Theory, a product of the integration of Marxism-Leninism with contemporary Chinese practices and characteristics, was established. It carries on and further develops the Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. As a crystallization of collective wisdom of the CPC, it will correctly guide the Chinese people to successfully achieve socialist modernization.Establishment and DevelopmentAfter the October Socialist Revolution in Soviet Union led by Lenin was victorious in 1917, Marxism spread to China. Some advanced Chinese intellectuals realized that Marxism was the true way of guiding the revolution to victory. In 1919, the May 4th Movement against imperialism and feudalism broke out in China. It awoke the Chinese people in an unprecedented way. After the movement, the Chinese working class, as an independent political force, entered the historical arena. A large number of revolutionary intellectuals who believed in Marxism including Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao and Mao Zedong set up communist groups across the country to spread Marxism and organize workers' movements. Marxism was thus integrated with the Chinese workers' movements, laying a foundation for the establishment of the CPC. Between July 23 and 31, 1921, Mao Zedong, He Shuheng, Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, Wang Jinmei, Deng Enming, Li Da, Li Hanjun, Zhang Guotao, Liu Renjing, Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai, representing 50-odd members of various communist groups, held the first National Congress of the CPC, and the Communist Party of China was therefore officially founded.After its establishment, the CPC led Chinese people in unfolding the New-Democratic Revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism (1919-1949). The revolution was divided into four periods: the Northern Expedition (1924-1927) of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the Agrarian Revolutionary War (1927-1937), the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) and the Chinese People's War of Liberation (1946-1949). With long-term armed struggles and the close coordination of various aspects and various forms of struggles, the CPC finally achieved a victory in 1949 and established the People's Republic of China , which, under the leadership of the working class and based on the workers-peasants alliance, upholds the people's democratic dictatorship.After the founding of the PRC, the CPC led the nation to make constant progress: triumphing over repeated threats, sabotages and armed provocation of imperialists and hegemonists, safeguarding the nation's independence and security; successfully achieving a great transfer of the Chinese society from new-democratism to socialism, accomplishing, in a general sense, the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production; and launching the large-scale socialist economic construction in a planned way, and enabling Chinese economic and cultural causes to attain unprecedented development.Beginning in 1979, China introduced reforming policies advocated by Deng Xiaoping and opened its door to the outside world. The "left deviation" errors made during the "cultural revolution" and before were redressed, and the focus of the work was shifted to the modernization drive. Great efforts were made to regulate the proportions within the national economy, reform economic and political systems and gradually establish a road to build socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. The past two decades have witnessed substantial changes in China. It is the best period that China has ever experienced since 1949 and also the period when the people of China received the most substantial benefits.The CPC now has over 58 million members. It requires its members, being self-disciplined and having the spirit of making personal sacrifices, to set a good example for the masses in production, work, study and social lives.The Basic Line at Present Stage and the Basic Stand in International AffairsChina will be at the primary stage of socialism for a long period of time.The basic line of the CPC at this stage is to unite the people of all ethnic groups to, with economic construction at the core, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening-up, and in a spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, to build China into a prosperous, democratic and civilized modern socialist country. The Four Cardinal Principles -- adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China -- have been established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China as the basis to maintain the nation.The Chinese Communist Party stands for positively developing foreign relations in order to win over a favorable international environment for China's reform and opening-up drive as well as the modernization construction. In international affairs, it adheres to an independent foreign policy of peaceful coexistence and safeguards China's independence and sovereignty. It opposes hegemonism and power politics, safeguards world peace, and promotes the progress of mankind. It stands for the development of state relations with other countries on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. It insists on developing good-neighborly relations with surrounding countries and strengthening unity and cooperation with developing countries. It develops relations with Communist parties and other political parties of other countries on the principle of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.Organizational SystemThe Communist Party of China is an integral body organized under its program and constitution, on the principles of democratic centralism. The basic principles of democratic centralism are:a) Individual Party members are subordinate to the Party organizations, the minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower Party organizations are subordinate to the higher Party organizations, and all the constituent organizations and members of the Party are subordinate to the National Congress and the Central Committee of the Party;b) The Party's leading organizations at all levels, except the representative offices sent out by them and the Party organizations in non-CPC organizations, will be produced through election;c) The highest leading body of the CPC is the National Congress and the Central Committee it creates.

The Party organizations at lower level should not only ask for instructions from and report their work to their superiors but also independently solve the problems within their own jurisdiction. The Party organizations at different levels should exchange information, supports and supervision. They should enable Party members to understand and participate more in Party's affairs;e) Party's committees at various levels practice a system of integrating the collective leadership with individual responsibility. All major issues shall be decided upon by the Party committees after democratic discussion.

The voters have the right to learn about the candidates, require the change of candidates, vote against all candidates, and to vote for others. No organization or individual shall force voters to vote for or against a certain candidate by any means. If there is a case of violating the Party's Constitution during the election of various local Party congresses and grass-roots congresses, the Party committee at the higher lever, upon investigation and verification, shall make the decision to declare the ballot invalid and adopt corrective measures, and then report to its superior for examination and approval.
