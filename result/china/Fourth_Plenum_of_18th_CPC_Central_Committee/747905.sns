China announces new rules to facilitate law enforcement
2014-10-23 00:47:00 GMT
New rules released on Wednesday will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to learn about and freeze investments, including equities of people who fail to honor court orders.According to a circular to improve law enforcement, industrial and commercial watchdogs and courts should be connected to help law enforcement officials check out investments of the parties concerned.The circular said industrial and commercial authorities should assist court authorities in carrying out court judgements regarding the changing of shareholders.In the past, the two authorities varied procedures for changing owners of equities, making enforcement of most of these court orders a tough job.The circular said a list of the people who defaulted on court orders should be worked out for the industrial and commercial authorities to tighten its supervision over their credit.The two sides will also work together to ensure the offenders of economic crimes including corruption and infringement of property, will not hold posts in board of directors or board of supervisors in a certain period prescribed by law.The circular was jointly released by the Supreme People's Court and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
