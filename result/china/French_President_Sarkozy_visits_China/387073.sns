PARIS, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- France will stick to budget commitments and growth targets despite rising fears of a global financial downturn and is able to maintain it triple A credit rating, French Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse said on Tuesday.In an interview with radio broadcaster RTL, Pecresse, also the government spokeswoman, said the country would not deviate from the "path of public finances recovery," and called "all the politicians from the right and the left to follow this path.""We'll hold our commitments. Since 2010, we narrowed constantly our deficit and we'll go on ... If it takes more efforts, we will make more efforts", she added.According to monthly deficit figures release by the budget ministry, France registered a budget gap at 61.3 billion euros (87.47 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of June, roughly stable from the revised 61.7 billion euros (88.05 billion US dollars) a year earlier.Pecresse said the government planned to cut the budget deficit from 5.7 percent of the GDP this year to 3 percent in 2013, by cutting public spending and getting rid of tax loopholes. The country's economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and by 2.25 percent in 2012.The minister stressed France was able to maintain its triple A credit rating, in a move to reassure morose stock markets which plunged following credit rating agency Standard and Poor's U.S. rating downgrade last week.
