PARIS, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon on Wednesday revised the country's growth forecast in 2011 to 1.75 percent from 2.0 percent in the context of global recession."Realism leads us to adjust growth estimation ... for 2012, caution is even more required," said the premier.As to budget deficit, the government kept its target of 5.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year."To compensate the slowing economy we'll take the necessary measures to meet deficit target (which) is intangible and represents an economic and social necessity", the premier told reporters.With this aim, the government needs to collect additional revenue worth 12 billion euros (17.3 billion U.S. dollars) by 2012 by imposing new tax on higher revenue and capping public spending, according to Fillion."Do not overreact to daily changes in markets. Do not fall into excessive pessimism, while France's economic fundamentals are strong," he said, in response to rising worries about the country's ability to tackle deficit problem while maintain growth.French Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse said earlier Wednesday that France will revise its 2011 growth target due to sluggish economic results this quarter and the eurozone debt crisis.Earlier this month, France, also Europe's second largest economy, saw zero growth in the second quarter of 2011 after seeing GDP rise by 0.9 percent a quarter earlier.Reports said France needs to save 4 billion euros (5.79 billion U.S. dollars) this year and 10 billion euros (14.47 billion dollars) in 2012 to cut the budget deficit from 5.7 percent of GDP this year to 3 percent in 2013.France had initially expected to expand growth by 2 percent this year and by 2.25 percent in 2012.
