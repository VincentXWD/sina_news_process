He wished to cooperate with China to ensure that the G20 summit will make progress on promoting strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth and advancing reform of the international financial system.Calderon also expressed his readiness to work with China to safeguard the interests of developing countries and emerging economies.Hu said since Calderon became president, he has led the Mexican government and people to actively address challenges posed by globalization and the international financial crisis.He expressed his gladness and appreciation of the remarkable achievements made by Mexico in social and economic development over the years.Calderon said the Chinese president's attendance at the G20 summit is very significant because China has an increasingly important status on the global stage.Hu's visit will contribute greatly to boosting and deepening the Mexico-China relations, he added.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Mexico. Hu said links between the two countries have entered a new stage of mature, steady and extensive growth.The two countries established a strategic partnership in 2003. During Calderon's visit to China in 2008, the two countries reached a series of consensus and decided to set up a strategic dialogue mechanism, Hu said.The mechanism of permanent binational commission has become more mature and complete over the years, and played an important role in guiding the friendly cooperation in various areas between the two sides, he said.The two countries have already developed two joint action plans through the mechanism, Hu said, adding that the fifth meeting of the cooperation commission held in China this year had achieved major results.Hu said China has already become the second largest trade partner of Mexico, while Mexico is the second largest trade partner of China in Latin America and also has the most frequent cultural exchanges with China.The two sides have maintained sound communication and cooperation on major regional and international issues, Hu said.Hu pointed out that under the current international situation of complex changes, deepening strategic cooperation between China and Mexico is of great significance. China is ready to work with Mexico to advance bilateral cooperation in a long-term, healthy and stable way.At the meeting, Hu also put forward a four-point proposal on advancing China-Mexico ties.Firstly, Hu said, the two countries should plan for the future of bilateral links from a strategic height and with a long-term view. The two sides should use all forms of political mechanism to enhance mutual trust and support each other on issues of their core interests and major concern.Secondly, the two sides should tap the potential and expand the channels of cooperation on the basis of their own specific development strategy by increasing reciprocal investment and stepping up cooperation in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, infrastructure development and tourism, he said, calling on both sides to promote bilateral trade in a healthy and balanced way.Thirdly, the two sides should strengthen cultural and educational cooperation and advance friendly exchanges between their political parties, legislatures, local governments, media and non-government organizations in a bid to enhance mutual understanding.Fourthly, the two sides should strengthen coordination within the multilateral frameworks of the UN, G20 and APEC. The two countries should cooperate closely on major international issues, safeguard the common interests of developing countries and join effort to build a harmonious world.Calderon said Mexico and China, both as developing countries, should cooperate closely and advance bilateral links on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits. Leaders of the two countries have also maintained frequent contact and the permanent binational commission has promoted trade and economic cooperation.Referring to the upcoming summit, Hu said in an interview with leading Mexican newspaper Reforma that the G20 members have to sustain and strengthen the "hard-won" momentum of economic recovery."The world economy is now on the path of recovery and the prospect of economic growth is improving to some extent," Hu said, warning that such recovery is still facing unpredictability."In the current world economic environment, the G20 members should work together in difficult times and pursue win-win cooperation," he said."In Los Cabos, I look forward to exploring with leaders of other G20 members ways to promote world economic stability, recovery and growth."After a visit to Denmark, Hu arrived in Los Cabos on Saturday to attend the seventh summit of the G20 which will be held on Monday and Tuesday.Related:President Hu receives written interview with Mexican newspaperChinese President Hu Jintao received a written interview with Reforma, a major Mexican newspaper prior to the G20 summit due to be held in Los Cabos from June 18 to 19.
