China's social media users had a chance to learn of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's activities during his trip to China via Weibo, the popular Chinese Twitter-like platform.Modi updated his social media status on Weibo hours after he arrived in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi province,the hometown of President Xi Jinping.He began updating his Weibo accounts at about 2:30 pm with five new posts in Chinese.In the newest post he said, "I am very happy to experience Chinese hospitality and there is a very special cultural bond (between China and India)."Modi also posted photos showing his visit to the Terracotta Warriors Museum and the Daxingshan Temple – a Buddhist temple housing works translated from Sanskrit – in Xi'an. In one of the photos, he was seen communicating with a monk.The Indian prime minister received a warm welcome in Xi'an with local residents rushing to the street to get a face-to-face "hello" with Modi, according to a China Daily correspondent in Xi'an.In the afternoon, Modi was scheduled to visit Big Wild Goose Pagoda (Dayan Pagoda), a well-preserved ancient building and a holy place for Buddhists.
