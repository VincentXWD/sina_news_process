HARBIN, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture on Saturday urged local agricultural departments to prepare for a possible spring drought in China's northeastern regions.Agricultural authorities at all levels should make early arrangements for spring seeding in the drought-hit regions, rendering more policy and technology supports, said Chen Mengshan, chief economist with the ministry.Northeastern regions have been seeing less rain since last autumn, with precipitation down 30 to 80 percent compared with a normal year, Chen said at a meeting held in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province.The ministry predicted that western parts of northeastern regions will continue to see less rainfall, which will increase chances for a spring drought, while eastern parts may experience low temperatures and rainy weather, posing threats to sowing and planting.Northeastern regions are the country's main grain production areas, with Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region yielding 23 percent of the country's total grain output.
