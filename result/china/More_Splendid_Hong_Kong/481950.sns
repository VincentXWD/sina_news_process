Hu sang the song Ode to the Motherland together with the performers.With all audience standing up singing in chorus, cheering and applauding, the event was perfectly drawn to the end.Outside, the skyscrapers and landmarks that lie on both sides of the renowned Victoria Harbor were illuminated in a vibrant light show.Hu arrived here Friday to attend celebrations marking the 15th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule and the swearing- in of the new government of the special administrative region.
