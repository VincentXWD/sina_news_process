YILIANG, Yunnan, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven schools in Yiliang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province had resumed classes as of Monday afternoon after multiple earthquakes struck the area earlier this month, the county's education department said.The earthquakes left three students dead and injured another 22 students and three teachers, the department said.A total of 294 schools were damaged to varying degrees, affecting 94,861 students, the department said.The department said it examined all quake-hit school buildings for possible safety risks before allowing classes to be resumed.Classes will not be fully resumed until more prefabricated buildings and construction materials are acquired, as there are still repairs that must be completed in some schools, the department said.Multiple earthquakes struck Yiliang and neighboring areas in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces on Sept. 7, killing 81 people and injuring more than 800 others.
