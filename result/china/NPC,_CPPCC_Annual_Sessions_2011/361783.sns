BEIJING - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began his online chat with netizens here at 9 am Sunday jointly hosted by the central government website (www.gov.cn) and Xinhua News Agency website (www.news.cn).He also said that the government is striving to ensure that the people live a comfortable life with security and confidence in the period of 2011-2015.China's development blueprint for the coming five years will place high emphasis on the efforts to improve the people's livelihood, Wen said.To enhance the people's living standards is "our work's starting point as well as the final aim," he said.Greater efforts will be made to boost social development and progress, especially in those key sectors and aspects concerning national development and mass interests, the premier said.Premier Wen held online chats with netizens on Feb 28, 2009 and Feb 27, 2010, respectively.Major Issues Discussed:Wen: China's rise lies in talents, education, not GDP"The whole world is talking about China's rise, and what the people talk about most is (China's) GDP. But I think China's rise lies in talents and education," he said.He said he attaches greater importance to two other figures: the proportion of education expenditure in GDP and the proportion of scientific R&D expenditure in production."That concerns our nation's future," he said.He also said an important aspect for China's higher-learning education reform is to encourage students' creative spirit and independent thinking, in a bid to foster more high-calibre talents.More than 6 million students graduate from universities in China every year.China to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDPWen Jiabao said that the country aims to reduce energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 16 to 17 percent by 2015 from 2011 levels."The target should be met through solid efforts," Wen made the pledge during an online chat with netizens.It is a rather arduous work to reach the goal of reducing energy consumption per unit of GDP by around 20 percent from 2005 levels by the end of 2010, he said," Even so, we achieved a 19.1 percent decrease."Wen criticized the mandatory black-out of residential power supply by local governments. He decried such actions as "self-deceptive" and harmful to people's lives, ordering the localities to resume residential power  supply immediately.The goal of energy saving and emission cut should be met through the closure of high energy-consuming enterprises such as small power plants and steel mills, he noted.Over the past five years, China has gradually replaced outdated thermal power plants with environmentally-friendly ones, saving more than 300 million tonnes of coal.　[1]　[2]　[3]　[4]　[5]　[6]　[7]　[Next]
