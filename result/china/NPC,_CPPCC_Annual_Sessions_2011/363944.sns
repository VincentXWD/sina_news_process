BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Rotten potatoes and unwanted chicken wings represent a novel form of energy, otherwise they could risk food safety, said two Chinese political advisors who called for legislation against improper handling of kitchen waste."The legislature should make laws to guarantee that kitchen waste is properly treated and recycled into assets," said Yao Aixing, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top political advisory body.Yao's proposal came at a time when most Chinese people, who have more disposable income, seem to be less thrifty when consuming food.
