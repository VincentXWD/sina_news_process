BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) should actively contribute to the implementation of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), the People's Daily says in an editorial to be published Monday.The editorial hails the achievements of the political advisory body in 2010, saying that the CPPCC and its members had made important contribution when the country grappled with various challenges to boost sound and fast social and economic development."We must be more willingly to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), unswervingly stick to the political development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue to push forward the cause of the CPPCC," the editorial says.The 2011-2015 period is crucial for China to deepen the reform and opening-up drive while accelerating the transformation of its economic growth pattern, the editorial says.The CPPCC should offer more proposals on the implementation of the 12th Five-Year Plan and tap into its special advantages to expand exchanges with the people in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and with the people overseas, it says.The draft of the 12th Five-Year Plan is expected to be approved on Monday at the closing of the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature.The CPPCC National Committee concluded its annual session in Beijing Sunday morning.
