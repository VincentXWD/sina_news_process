BEIJING, March 14 -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Monday that China is concerned about the situation in west Asia and north Africa, and any comparison between China and those countries is not right."We have followed closely the turbulence in some North African and Middle Eastern countries. We believe it is not right to draw an analogy between China and those countries," Wen told reporters.However, in an annual press briefing at the close of the nation's parliament, Wen acknowledged China faced a tough challenge in managing the economy amid rising public discontent over spiralling inflation."We face extremely daunting tasks and complex domestic and international situations," Wen said."We must work very hard if we are to achieve successes in our work on all fronts and achieve the goals we have set."(Xinhua/Agencies)
