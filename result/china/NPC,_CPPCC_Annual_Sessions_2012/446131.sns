BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Tuesday China will remain a developing country in the coming decade, calling for win-win cooperation with other parties to face global challenges.Yang made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 11th National People's Congress, the top legislature, in response to a question on China's role in the world in the next decade."China will remain a developing country, and there is still a long way to go before China will be able to achieve modernization," said Yang.He said that in the next ten years, the favorable and unfavorable factors in China's external environment are interwoven. However, on the whole, opportunities outweigh challenges for China."We have full confidence that we will be able to meet our goal," Yang added.Yang said changes will take place in the international architecture at a faster pace, and all parties will engage interaction to pursue stability and development.However, he said, regional and international hotspot issues and global challenges will become more prominent. The idea of sitting together in tough times to overcome difficulties together will gain stronger popular support."We believe that all countries should embrace win-win cooperation. While pursuing one's own interests, one also needs to take into account the interests of other countries. While enjoying one's rise, one should also fulfill its responsibilities," said Yang."We should work together to make international order more just and equitable and to build a more prosperous future of the world," Yang added.
