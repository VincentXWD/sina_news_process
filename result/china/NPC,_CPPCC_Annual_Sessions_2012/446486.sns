BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Wednesday that the imbalance of trade figures between China and the United States is questionable and "should be rethought," as the volume of China's overall trade surplus was far below that of the United States.

Chen made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the country's annual parliamentary session, citing figures that China's overall trade surplus exceeded 150 billion U.S.dollars last year, while that with the United States totalled more than 200 billion U.S.dollars."Anyone with the basic knowledge of economics and without bias would find a clear conclusion," said Chen, commenting on the exchange rate and trade issues between China and the United States.China believes that all countries should strive to maintain the exchange rates of their currencies basically stable amid the backdrop of financial crisis. To devaluate a currency deliberately is "not desirable" and will undermine economic recovery, said Chen.BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Wednesday that the imbalance of trade figures between China and the United States is questionable and "should be rethought," as the volume of China's overall trade surplus was far below that of the United States.Chen made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the country's annual parliamentary session, citing figures that China's overall trade surplus exceeded 150 billion U.S.dollars last year, while that with the United States totalled more than 200 billion U.S.dollars."Anyone with the basic knowledge of economics and without bias would find a clear conclusion," said Chen, commenting on the exchange rate and trade issues between China and the United States.China believes that all countries should strive to maintain the exchange rates of their currencies basically stable amid the backdrop of financial crisis.
