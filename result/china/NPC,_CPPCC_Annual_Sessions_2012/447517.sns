BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are some quotes on social security from Ouyang Minggao, a political advisor and vice chairman of China Democratic League, at the annual session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee on Saturday:-- Social security plays a role in continuously dissolving economic and social crisis. We must unswervingly accelerate the development of China's own social security net and build a socialist welfare society with China's characteristics.-- The development of China's social security net has just started and it's not the right time yet to worry about exorbitant welfare levels in the country.-- By 2020, China should put in place a complete social security net and greatly narrow the current welfare gap between different groups to benefit every person.ï¼Ÿ
