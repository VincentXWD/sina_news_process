BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are some quotes on air quality from Wang Yuqing, a political advisor and former deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, at the annual session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee on Saturday:-- We should take the revision of the Environmental Air Quality Standards as a good opportunity to draw up our own action plan to clean the air for our nation based on the actual conditions in our country and with reference to international practices.-- When planning the medium- and long-term development of science and technology, we should give special attention to the prevention and control of air pollution, release new standards that are in line with international practice and start monitoring PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 microns) and publish monitoring data in a timely manner.-- We should push for a green transition of our economy by legislation on more stringent air quality standards.-- We should make environmental information accessible for the public and encourage public participation in environmental policymaking and law enforcement by popularizing knowledge on environmental science.ï¼Ÿ
