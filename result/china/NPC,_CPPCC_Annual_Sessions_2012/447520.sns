BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are some quotes from Zhang Qiong, a political advisor, at the annual session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee on Saturday:-- The government should bear more responsibility in promoting the development of low-income housing.-- The central government should carry out different fund-raising policies in regions of different development levels. More fund from the central government should go to the central and western regions so that spending from local governments there can be lowered.-- The government should encourage private capital to invest in low-income housing projects with preferential policies.-- The government should collect property tax to increase its revenue and sustain government spending in low-income housing.-- The government should ensure a sufficient supply of land for low-income housing and adopt a rational ratio of land use for low-income housing and commercial housing.-- More resources should go to low-rent housing projects.-- Legislation on low-income housing is necessary to reduce uncertainties in government policies.
