BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Wednesday that China needs not only economic reform but also political reform, especially the reform of the leadership system of the Party and government.Wen warned at a press conference after the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session that tragedies like the Cultural Revolution may happen in China again should the country fail to push forward political reform to uproot problems occurring in the society.The country risks losing the results of the reform and opening up over the past three decades without further reforms, as new problems such as unfair income distribution, lack of integrity and corruption, have not been resolved."Reform has now come to a critical stage," Wen said, adding reforms must go forward, rather than stand still or even go backward.Â
