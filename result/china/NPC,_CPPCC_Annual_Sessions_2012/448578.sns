BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday expressed his willingness to meet with citizen critics of government policies in Zhongnanhai, the seat of the central government."I don't feel surprised at all that there have been some critical comments on the Internet about the performance of the government and I think it is only natural for that to happen," Wen said at a press conference after the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session.The government should create conditions for the people to criticize its work, he said.The government must seriously reflect on the critical views that people have made and, in fact, the government has often been inspired by such comments from the public when making decisions on major issues, he said."I have often thought about inviting some representatives of people, who on regular basis make critical comments about the work of the government, to Zhongnanhai so that we can have face-to-face discussion on issues they are interested in," he said.Wen said he had tried to do it when soliciting public views on drafting this year's government work report but more efforts should be done.As the country's premier, Wen admitted that some slanders about him have caused pain, though not disturbing him."I will continue to press ahead with my work and uphold my ideals without hesitation and misgiving," he said.
