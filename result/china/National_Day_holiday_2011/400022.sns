The refund fee for train tickets was cut from 20 percent to 5 percent on Sunday with a minimum fee of two yuan ($0.3). Some academics are worried it could cause scalpers to buy more tickets during peak periods, making getting tickets harder for regular passengers.Â Several experts including Ou Guoli from Beijing Jiaotong University said scalping before the real-name system is fully implemented could increase after the cut, the Beijing News reported on Sunday.Many Web users agreed with Ou's statement, among whom one microbloger named Jia-qiaoxiaosheng wrote that train tickets might be harder to buy with the refund fee decreased."We will lose less money when returning tickets even if we fail to sell them at a higher price, and therefore we will hoard more tickets," a scalper not giving his name in Beijng told the Global Times on Sunday.However, some support the policy and believe it will bring more pros than cons."I believe the policy of cutting the refund fee will help people save money when we return tickets," Mei Zhiyuan, a Nanjing resident in Jiangsu, told the Global Times on Sunday."The reduction of the refund fee serves people better," a staff member who declined to reveal his name with the Ministry of Railways told the Global Times on Sunday."In my opinion, the real-name system was not very effective cracking down on scalpers," Wang Mengshu, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, told the Global Times on Sunday. "I think the most basic way to solve the problem is to increase train trips. Only when the numbers of trains are increased will people not be worried about buying tickets. Thus scalpers will not have the chance to resell tickets."On top of cutting the refund fee, the Ministry of Railways announced another addition, selling bullet train tickets online starting Friday, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
