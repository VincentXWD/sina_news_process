BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- China's senior Party and state leaders attended a reception at central Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Thursday to celebrate the 62nd founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC).Jia Qingling, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), addressed the reception in the presence of Vice President Xi Jinping and Vice Premier Li Keqiang. All the three are members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.In his speech, the top political advisor extended, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, or China's Cabinet, a warm welcome to all the guests, particularly those from the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions (SARs), compatriots living in Taiwan, and overseas Chinese.The CPC, which celebrates its 90th founding anniversary this year, led the Chinese people in a 28-year struggle before the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, and, in the glorious 62 years since, the Chinese people have made a miracle in building and developing the nation, said Jia."We'll never forget compatriots living in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas, who have stood together and shared the happiness and woe of the Chinese people from different ethnic groups, regardless of the situation," he said.Jia thanked the leaders and governments of Hong Kong and Macao for what they have accomplished since the two SARs returned to the arms of the motherland in 1997 and 1999, respectively.In securing the central government's continued assistance to the two SAR governments, Jia expressed his strong support for further upgrading the advantages of Hong Kong and Macao in competitiveness, fostering newly emerging industries, and deepening their cooperation with the mainland.The central government will continue insisting on the policies of "One Country, Two Systems," "Hong Kong People Govern Hong Kong" and "Macao People Govern Macao," as well as a high degree of autonomy for the SAR governments to handle their internal affairs.Regarding the issue of achieving a "complete, peaceful reunification" of China, Jia reiterated that it is the common aspiration of all Chinese living both at home and abroad.In his speech, Jia also praised the "unique role" of overseas Chinese in realizing the great reinvigoration of the Chinese nation.
