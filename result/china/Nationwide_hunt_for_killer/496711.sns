The bullet shell is found through one side of his head, so obviously after he had fallen from a shot in his waist, he committed suicide. Head Shot Brother ultimately shot himself in the head.@ gaucho0 : Looking at the photos, he died from a shot to his temple. Can a frontal shot end up hitting someone in the temple?
