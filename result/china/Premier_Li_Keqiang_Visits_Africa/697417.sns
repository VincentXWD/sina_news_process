Born in 1957, Cheng Hong used to work at the countryside of Jia town in central Henan province during the Cultural Revolution, answering the call of Chairman Mao that educated youth should go to the countryside for re-education.The local newspaper Dahe News reported that Cheng worked hard in the production team, and was promoted as the head of the team soon. In an article Cheng Hong wrote for the state newspaper Guangming Daily, she expressed her cherished memory about the experience and the place:“I have been to many famous mountains and great waters in this country, but none of them could evoke my excitement and emotion as the Ru river (a branch of the yellow river that runs across Jia town) did. On the shore of the river I sweated and wept. There I pursued for my goals, and there I encountered bewilderment.”
