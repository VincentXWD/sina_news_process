PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's upcoming official visit to France, during which a host of deals are expected to be signed, is set to enhance bilateral practical cooperation and consolidate mutual political trust.During his stay in the European nation, the first by a Chinese premier in nearly a decade, Li will visit the French cities of Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, deliver a speech at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and attend the closing ceremony of a China-France business summit.He is also expected to meet with French President Francois Hollande, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and presidents of the French Senate and National Assembly, as well as the OECD's secretary general and the director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).An array of business contracts and government accords ranging from aviation and finance to civil nuclear power and joint development of third-party markets are expected to be signed during Li's visit.France was the first major Western country to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which happened in 1964, and Paris has long prioritized its relations with Beijing in its foreign policy.Li's trip comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a historic visit to France in 2014 upon the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties, during which the two sides agreed to elevate their relationship to a close and lasting comprehensive strategic partnership.The premier, according to Chinese Ambassador to France Zhai Jun, will discuss with French leaders a series of major international issues, including climate change and global economic governance.China has repeatedly voiced its support for France's efforts to host the United Nations climate change conference late this year.Li's visit also comes as China and the OECD mark the 20th anniversary of their partnership.According to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao, the premier's visit is expected to help the global economic organization better understand the stance of emerging markets and developing countries on development issues."The visit will inject fresh political momentum into the cooperation between China and the OECD," he told a press briefing.
