Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will meet European Union leaders at the 10th China-EU Business Summit on Monday in Brussels, a meeting that experts believe will further strengthen economic cooperation between China and the EU.This is the first meeting between Li and the EU's new leadership and 2015 is the 40th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic ties.China is willing to tie up with the investment plan initiated by Jean-Claude Juncker for reviving Europe's economy, Li said at the opening ceremony of the summit.In talks with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, Li said China firmly supports the European integration process and will be a responsible long-term holder of European bonds.China is playing an important role on many global issues, such as balancing the development of the global economy and trade, regional security and climate change, Schulz said.During his stay in Brussels, Li will co-chair the China-EU leaders' meeting with the new heads of the European Commission.Li also signed over 18 billion euros ($20 billion) in business ventures with Belgium on Monday.Feng Zhongping, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times Monday that the investment agreements between the two sides will make two-way investments much easier and provide a secure legal framework for both Chinese and European investors.The EU has been China's largest trading partner for 11 years while China has been the region's second largest trading partner for 12 years. Bilateral trade exceeded $600 billion in 2014.Facing the Greek debt default crisis, EU has been suffering from stagnant economic growth and European companies want to explore the Chinese market to increase exports, Feng said."The Juncker Investment Plan will unlock private investments by guaranteeing part of the investments with funds from the EU budget and the European Investment Bank, and if it connects with "Belt and Road," private Chinese investors can participate and help ease the EU budget's problems," Feng said.Earlier, Chinese Ambassador to the EU Yang Yanyi said that China also looks forward to enhancing cooperation with the EU in technology and innovation.
