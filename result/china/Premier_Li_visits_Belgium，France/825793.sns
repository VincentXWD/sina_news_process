BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhuanet) -- China on Wednesday officially joined the Development Centre of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) during Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's historic visit to the OECD headquarters here.Li Wei, President of the Chinese Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC), accepted OECD's official invitation to join the OECD Development Centre.OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria welcomed China's entry as a "historic and transformative opportunity for mutually beneficial knowledge-sharing.""Membership recognizes both China's sound experience in development and the Development Centre's role in convening a policy dialogue between OECD and non-OECD countries to advance policy solutions and best practices for sustainable development," he added.For Mario Pezzini, director of the OECD Development Centre, "China's membership will help strengthen partnerships with governments and institutions in countries throughout Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean, and Central and Southeast Asia."According to OECD, the entry of China to the OECD Development Centre marks an important step in support of China's transformation and transition to a new growth model, which will help inform China's increasing engagement with developing countries and the global community, including through endeavors such as the "Road and Belt" initiatives."The OECD Development Centre has carried out significant research and dialogue on inclusive growth, economic restructuring, poverty reduction, and sustainable development," stated Li Wei."We would like to exchange our experience in development with other members of the center, including the lessons we have learned," he added.The OECD Development Centre is a forum where countries come to share their experiences of economic and social development policies to help decision makers find policy solutions to stimulate growth and improve living conditions in developing and emerging economies.
