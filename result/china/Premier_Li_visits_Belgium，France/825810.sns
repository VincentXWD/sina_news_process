China on Wednesday officially joined the Development Centre of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) during Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's historic visit to the OECD headquarters.Li Wei, president of the Chinese Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC), accepted OECD's official invitation to join the OECD Development Centre.OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria welcomed China's entry as a "historic and transformative opportunity for mutually beneficial knowledge-sharing.""Membership recognizes both China's sound experience in development and the Development Centre's role in convening a policy dialogue between OECD and non-OECD countries to advance policy solutions and best practices for sustainable development," he added.According to OECD, the entry of China marks an important step in support of China's transformation and transition to a new growth model, which will help inform China's increasing engagement with developing countries and the global community, including through endeavors such as the "Road and Belt" initiatives.The OECD Development Centre is a forum where countries come to share their experiences of economic and social development policies.This is believed to be the first time for a Chinese leader to visit the OECD headquarters in the past two decades.Addressing the OECD in Paris on Wednesday, Premier Li said that China aims to graduate from its status as a developing country by the middle of this century and can achieve its economic growth target of around 7 percent in 2015 despite a slowdown since the start of this year."Through our hard work, we have the ability and confidence to achieve our target of around 7 percent growth for this year," he said.He earlier said quantitative easing (QE) measures were not the only way to boost an economy, saying a streamlined administration, proper competition and a better business environment for foreign investors were also key.
