MOSCOW, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- Increasing exchanges between youths of Russia and China have forged better mutual understanding and will inject sustained vitality into bilateral ties, says Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets."New generations, who better acknowledge and understand each other's culture and value systems, are taking shape in Russia and China," Golodets told Xinhua in a recent interview."That will positively influence the political climate of bilateral relations in the coming decades, and facilitate joint programs in various social spheres," she added.The two sides have prepared more than 300 activities within the framework of the Russia-China Youth Friendly Exchange Years in 2014 and 2015, including large-scale two-way youth visits, language contests, sport games, youth forums and art festivals.Some 100,000 youths from both countries are expected to participate in these events, which will lay a solid foundation for lasting friendship, Golodets said.She recalled a five-day art festival held in Russia's Far East city of Chita in July, saying she was deeply impressed by the wonderful events attended by over 4,000 university students from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's member states, observers and dialogue partners.The Chinese delegation was one of the largest teams in the art festival, she added.Noting the China-Russia youth symphony orchestra had successfully accomplished its debut in St. Petersburg in March, the deputy prime minister said the philharmonic will also play at next year's ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.Speaking of education exchanges, Golodets, who is in charge of the humanities sector, said relevant institutions of both countries have undertaken over 900 cooperation projects.Moscow State University, the flagship of Russia's high level educational institution, will establish a joint university in Shenzhen, a booming city in south China's Guangdong Province."That will mark another major step in bilateral cooperation in the field of education," Golodets said.In addition, the two countries have experimentally launched a youth contest project known as "It's time to study in Moscow," in which Chinese winners will receive Russian scholarship and study in Russia.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is to visit Russia and attend the 19th regular meeting between the two countries' prime ministers with Dmitry Medvedev."The upcoming meeting between the two prime ministers will undoubtedly further promote cooperation in various spheres, including youth exchanges," Golodets said. "We are looking forward to Li's visit."
