MILAN, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The tenth Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) opened in Milan, Italy on Thursday under the theme of "Responsible Partnership for Growth and Security."European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said at the meeting that Asia and Europe need each other both economically and politically, and security is also inter-linked, "or one could even consider it a single, united Eurasian continent.""In the 21st century, no country can remain in isolation. We need to effectively connect our regions -- in physical, digital, institutional and human terms -- to make our partnership truly beneficial," he said.Countries brought together by the ASEM represent more than 60 percent of the world's population, half of the world's gross domestic product and 60 percent of global trade, according to Van Rompuy.Van Rompuy also welcomed that the ASEM accepted Kazakhstan and Croatia as its members, making it a 53-member forum. He stressed that the ASEM will continue to enlarge and attract new members.The summit, running from October Oct. 16-17, will focus on enhancement of financial and economic cooperation between Asia and Europe as trade and investments are key for further growth and jobs.Moreover, matters of global concern will be discussed at the summit such as climate change, natural disasters, health, epidemics, international crime and terrorism, issues that affect all and require national efforts and broad international cooperation.The ASEM leaders will convene in a retreat session for the first time on the second day of the summit to discuss current international and regional affairs, according to Van Rompuy.The summit will also steer the future direction of the ASEM in view of the ASEM 20th anniversary in 2016. The ASEM, founded in 1996, is a high-level and large-scale inter-governmental platform of dialogues and cooperation between the two continents.Â
