HANNOVER, Germany, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Monday called for more concerted efforts to enhance pragmatic cooperation between his country and Germany.Addressing the China-Germany Business Summit held in this German city, he proposed that the two countries strive together to double their bilateral trade to 280 billion U.S. dollars by 2015.To achieve that goal, the two sides should further expand bilateral trade, improve market access and fight trade protectionism, the premier told the audience of some 600 senior government officials and business leaders from the two countries.Meanwhile, China and Germany should promote two-way investment, he said, adding that they need to continue cooperation in such traditional fields as auto, chemical and mechanical industries while gradually shifting to such areas as high-end manufacturing, marine and polar research and aviation and space technologies.Moreover, Wen urged the two countries to expand cooperation in environmental protection, suggesting that they strengthen cooperation in the formulation of energy-saving standards as well as in new energy technologies, green architecture and environment-friendly urban planning.In parallel, he urged China and Germany to strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Through such events as the "Year of Chinese Culture" in Germany and the "China-Germany Bridge to the Future," the two countries can promote exchanges between the two peoples, especially between the youths, and deepen their friendship, he said.Speaking highly of the development of China-Germany ties since the two countries established diplomatic relations 40 years ago, Wen said bilateral relations have withstood the severe tests of the changing international situation and maintained smooth development, and are progressing on a mature, healthy and stable track.Today, China-Germany cooperation is at its more extensive, most vibrant and most fruitful period, said the Chinese leader.As long as the two sides view each other positively, work for mutual benefit and engage in consultations on equal footing, their cooperation based on complementary advantages and common interests will surely deepen steadily, he said.In face of the complex and volatile international situation, China and Germany have growing common interests and growing responsibilities, he said."We must cherish our hard-won achievements, and with more active attitudes, expand our pragmatic cooperation to more fields and take it to a higher level," Wen said.Wen also encouraged business leaders of the two countries to seize the opportunities to open a new chapter in the China-Germany strategic partnership and blaze a bright trail of win-win cooperation.German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the opening of the China-Germany Business Summit, which was jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Federation of German Industries.Also on Monday, Wen and Merkel attended the opening of the Chinese section at the 2012 Hannover Messe. The two leaders then jointly toured China's and Germany's exhibition booths.
