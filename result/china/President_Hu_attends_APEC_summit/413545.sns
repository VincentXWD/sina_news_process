The Hawaiian Islands remain open for business during APEC Leaders' Week (Nov. 7-13). With more than 75,000 hotel rooms and other lodging accommodations available across our state, there will be sufficient accommodations available beyond the rooms booked in Waikiki for APEC.Hawaii has nearly 800 flights arriving into the state during Leaders Week, so there will be adequate air seats available. As with any travel period, we recommend that visitors book early to secure their preferred accommodations and flights.
