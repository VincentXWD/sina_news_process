The Hawaii bid, submitted in January 2008, was a collaborative effort between the East-West Center, Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Congressional Delegation, the military and a host of Hawaii business leaders. Hawaii was among several US locations vying to host the 2011 APEC Leaders Meeting. During 2009 APEC Summit in Singapore, President Barack Obama announced Honolulu, Hawaii as the host city for the 2011 Leaders Meeting.
