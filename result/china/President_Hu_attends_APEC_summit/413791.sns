by Vienna MaCANBERRA, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions and Australian Greens on Monday raised concerns over the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade deal, but Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted the deal will mean more business and more jobs for Australia.Leaders of nine APEC countries, including Australia and U.S., have reached a broad agreement on the free-trade pact, Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP), which sets out to eliminate all tariffs and introduce new uniform labor and intellectual property standards across the Asia-Pacific.The Coalition supports the idea, and that Australia must continue to expand its export markets, especially as there had been a lack of progress in negotiating a multilateral agreement through the Doha Round of world trade talks, while the Greens have warned it should not disadvantage Australia.Australian Greens deputy leader Christine Milne said the TPP is biased towards the U.S."The United States, which is driving this agenda, is coming back to get what it didn't succeed in getting through the US- Australia free trade agreement," Senator Milne said in a statement.Labor senator Doug Cameron agreed, saying more scrutiny was needed, because normally the big players get the best deal, such as the U,S, when they sign an agreement with Australia.Australian Manufacturing Workers Union spokesman Dave Oliver said he was particularly worried about the potential impact on the pharmaceutical industry."We know the United States have been keen to try and pare back our pharmaceutical benefits scheme," he said."We know the United States are keen to ensure they can extend the patent laws on pharmaceutical products which make it harder for our pharmaceutical manufacturers to manufacture generic products."He added the government should not rush headlong into the agreement, and Australia need to make sure they got core issues addressed, including labour standards, environmental standards, proper access to markets, as well as to ensure that Australia can maintain its own sovereign rights.National Farmers' Federation president Jock Laurie is backing anything that increases Australia's access to overseas markets, saying that "any continued discussion to try and break down some of those barriers and knock down some of the tariffs is a good thing."Despite the concerns, Gillard maintains the TPP agreement is good news for Australia and the economy."We are a great trading nation, and so freer trade with our growing region means Australian jobs," she said.The nine APEC leaders from Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, U.S. and Vietnam, aim to finalize the TPP deal next year.
