Kalakaua Park (at the intersection of Kalakau and Kuhio Avenues) ended up being the final destination of the Anti-APEC / Occupy Honolulu march from Old Stadium Park in Moili'ili to Waikiki on November 12, 2011. The marchers wanted to get as close to Hale Koa, the hotel where many APEC guest are staying, but police officers and temporary barricades prevented them from getting closer than Wailana Coffee House on Ala Moana Boulevard.
