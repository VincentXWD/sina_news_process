HONOLULU, United States. Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies on Sunday concluded their annual consultation here to promote trade and regional integration. The leaders have chosen to add some certainty to the uncertain world economy, while trying to gain some momentum in promoting next generation growth models and trade issues.In remarks to the press after the meeting, U.S. President Barack Obama said leaders agreed to "a series of steps that will increase trade and bring our economies even closer."The steps include "a new set of principles on innovation to encourage the entrepreneurship that creates new businesses and new industries."With simplified customs and exemptions from certain tariffs, Obama said, the economies would "encourage more businesses to engage in more trade," including small businesses.Trade facilitation has always been the core message of APEC. The message now comes at a time of great economic uncertainty, with developed economies mired in slow recovery and growth, while suffering high unemployment, and Asian countries are faced with inflationary pressures and slowed growth.The situation is most dire in Europe, where the eurozone crisis threatens the Asia-Pacific rim, which accounts for half the world's economy.In remarks to the APEC CEO summit on Saturday, Obama said the world was unlikely to see "massive growth out of Europe until the problem is resolved. And that will have a dampening effect on the overall global economy.""But if we can at least contain the crisis," Obama said, "then one of the great opportunities we have is to see the Asia Pacific region as an extraordinary engine for growth."APEC leaders, in their Honolulu Declaration -- Toward a Seamless Regional Economy, concluded they were meeting at "a time of uncertainty for the global economy. Growth and job creation have weakened in many economies, and significant downside risks remain, including those arising from the financial challenges in Europe and a succession of natural disasters in our region."The declaration said the challenges had only strengthened member economies' commitment to cooperation as the way forward. "Building on the Yokohama Vision, we firmly resolve to support the strong, sustained, and balanced growth of the regional and global economy," it said.To realize the goal, a new way forward has been charted. Leaders have agreed to "develop an APEC list of environmental goods that directly and positively contribute to our green growth and sustainable development objectives, on which we are resolved to reduce by the end of 2015 our applied tariff rates to 5 percent or less, taking into account economies' economic circumstances, without prejudice to APEC economies' positions in the WTO," the declaration said.APEC economies would also take a series of steps to promote green growth goals, including aspiring to reduce APEC's aggregate energy intensity by 45 percent by 2035.But APEC is also a diverse family, with members in different stages of development. Developing members have called on developed members to give more help in financing and technology regarding green growth.Just as Chinese President Hu Jintao said in remarks at the meeting, economic globalization is gaining momentum, countries are becoming increasingly interdependent economically, and new changes are underway in global economic governance."Our goal is to achieve sustained, steady and fairly fast economic growth and social harmony and stability in our region," Hu said.
