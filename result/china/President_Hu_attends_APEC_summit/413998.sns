HONOLULU, United States, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- China will definitely abide by the rules agreed on by the international community, but will "have to know whose rules we are talking about," a Chinese diplomat said on Sunday.Pang Sen, deputy head of Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks in response to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk's demand that "China play by the rules.""If the rules are made by the international community through agreement and China is part of it, China will definitely abide by them," Pang told a press briefing of the Chinese delegation at the end of the APEC economic leaders' meeting in Honolulu."But if the rules are decided by one or several countries, China does not have the obligation to observe them," said Pang.On the issues of targets on energy intensity reduction and the liberalization of environmental goods and services, Pang said it is quite understandable that member economies have different views or priority areas due to the diversity of the Asia-Pacific region and differences among member economies in their economic development stage, capacity to face the challenges and energy mix."The documents reached by the leaders over the above two issues not only demonstrate the ambition of all APEC member economies, but also accommodate the differences among the member economies, and this is a result through consensus-building," Pang said.He added that the target of energy intensity reduction is voluntary and non-binding.According to the Honolulu Declaration reached by the leaders here Sunday, economies will work to develop in 2012 an APEC list of environmental goods that directly and positively contribute to green growth and sustainable development objectives, on which tariffs will be reduced to 5 percent or less by the end of 2015.APEC economies would take a series of steps to promote green growth goals, including reducing APEC's aggregate energy intensity by 45 percent by 2035, the document said.As for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade agreement negotiated between the United States and eight other APEC economies, Pang said China holds an open attitude toward all initiatives which are conducive to promoting economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region."We hope all the mechanisms could remain transparent and inclusive. Only when a mechanism can attract the most possible members to come in, it could make more contribution to the region," Pang said.A series of APEC meetings were held here from Tuesday to Sunday.
