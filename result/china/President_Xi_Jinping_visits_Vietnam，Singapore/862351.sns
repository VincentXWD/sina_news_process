BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- Non-Communist parties and mainland-based groups of people from Taiwan are upbeat over the upcoming meeting between Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou, saying the face-to-face talk will elevate the cross-Strait relations to a new high."The meeting undoubtedly conforms to the fundamental interests of people across the Taiwan Strait, and is a politically wise move aimed at a better future," said Wan E'xiang, chair of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.Xi and Ma's meeting is the result of the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, said Lin Wenyi, chair of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.This will be the first meeting since 1949 and will be a turning point in relations, she said, adding that it was welcomed by all people on the island.Yang Yizhou, vice president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, an association of Taiwan people on the mainland, lauded the meeting as it will "raise the cross-Strait relations to a new high.""On the basis of 1992 Consensus centering on one-China principle and the principle of opposing 'Taiwan independence,' everything can be negotiated by the two sides," said Yang.
