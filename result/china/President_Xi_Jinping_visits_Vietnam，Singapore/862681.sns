SINGAPORE, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping told Ma Ying-jeou Saturday that no force can pull apart the two sides across the Taiwan Strait which are "one family."The 66-year history of the development of cross-Strait relations shows that no matter how much ordeal the two sides have undergone and how long the two sides have been isolated from each other, they cannot be pulled apart, Xi said at a historic meeting between leaders of the two sides in Singapore."We are brothers who are still connected by our flesh even if our bones are broken," Xi said.
