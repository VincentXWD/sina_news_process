Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived here on Friday for a state visit to Argentina, the second leg of his four-nation Latin America tour.Xi is scheduled to hold talks with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez and other leaders during the visit.Upon his arrival in Buenos Aires, Xi said the China-Argentina strategic partnership, which greets its 10th anniversary this year, has stood the test of constant changes in the international landscape and is at a historic moment from which it will move to a new era based on past achievements.The president said he looks forward to having extensive exchanges of views with Argentine leaders and people from various circles in a bid to further advance bilateral relations for better development of both countries."Meanwhile, I hope to demonstrate the resolve of developing countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and also boost the confidence in the development prospects of emerging markets," he said.Since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1972, the relations have moved forward rapidly.
