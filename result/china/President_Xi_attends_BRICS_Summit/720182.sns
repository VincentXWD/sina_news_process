CARACAS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuela-China relationship has embarked on a fast track for development and is now "in its best shape ever", said Venezuelan Vice Foreign Affairs Minister for Asia Xoan Noya.In a recent interview with Xinhua, Noya said over the past 40 years, great progress has been made in the development of bilateral ties, and the pace has been increasing since the establishment of strategic partnership in 2001 and the setting up of a joint financing fund in 2008.Noya noted that late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had visited China six times, the most among Latin American leaders, and laid a solid foundation for the rapid development of bilateral relations.During President Nicolas Maduro's visit to China last year, a total of 24 cooperation agreements were inked between the two sides, some of which are being implemented, said Noya."Every high-level meeting between Venezuelan and Chinese leaders has yielded important results and constantly achieved fresh progress in friendly and pragmatic cooperation. Therefore, Venezuela holds high expectation for President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit," said the minister.He voiced his belief that Xi's visit will chart the course for the future development of bilateral ties. The two countries will continue to deepen political mutual trust, expand cooperation in various areas and strengthen cultural exchanges.Venezuela and China had signed only 30 cooperative deals by 1999 but the number has by now exceeded 400 covering such fields as energy, agriculture, infrastructure, science and technology, culture and education, which indicates an all-faceted model of strategic cooperation has been formed, he said."Most importantly, friendly cooperation between the two countries has brought concrete benefits to the Venezuelan people in every aspect."Citing China's Huawei, ZTE, Chery Automobile, Qianjiang Motorcycle and Haier as examples, he said those companies have set up factories in Venezuela and their low-priced quality products are very popular among the locals.China's Citic Construction Company also participated in an governmental housing project and solved housing problems for low- and medium-income citizens, Noya added.He said Venezuela's future development requires large amount of advanced science and technology, which makes cooperation with China indispensable."The strategic cooperation with China plays an important role in Venezuela's national development scheme for the next 10 years," he asserted, adding that the country's future development is closely linked with China.Venezuela has long been committed to building a peaceful and multi-polar international landscape as well as a fair and just world economic order, opposing hegemonism and power politics, said Noya."What we believe, in this regard, is entirely consistent with China's independent and peaceful foreign policy. China has proved to be our friendly and reliable partner and an important power in safeguarding regional as well as world peace and stability," Noya said.
