Chinese President Xi Jinping signed a raft of oil and mineral deals with Venezuela on Monday (July 21), his latest stop on a Latin American tour.During his four-country visit to what is often considered America's back yard, Xi has reached out to resource-rich countries such as Venezuela and Argentina at a time when they are often shunned by the United States and Europe.In Venezuela, he visited the mausoleum holding late president Hugo Chavez, and signed 38 deals with Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro.The deals spanned a range of sectors from oil to infrastructure and included $4 billion for a joint development fund, US$691 million to explore Venezuela's gold and copper reserves and an agreement to develop the countries' third joint satellite."Venezuela has become one of the top countries for Chinese investment... our seventh oil supplier and fourth Latin American trade partner," Xi said in Caracas.The Venezuela visit comes after the Chinese leader agreed to an US$11-billion currency swap with Argentina and extended much-needed investment to President Cristina Kirchner, whose cash-strapped government, locked out of capital markets since defaulting on its debt in 2001, is staring down the threat of another default.Xi kicked off his tour last week by proposing a new US$20-billion infrastructure fund for Latin America, underlining the fast-growing Asian giant's increasing interest in the region.He also launched a new US$50-billon development bank along with the other emerging powers of the so-called BRICS group - Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa - at a summit in Brazil.The move, which creates an alternative to the Western-dominated World Bank, was hailed as contributing to "a new international order" by Cuban President Raul Castro - Xi's host at the next and final stop on his tour.(Agencies)
