SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday visited the historically glorious city of Santiago de Cuba, and stressed that only by remembering history can nations create a better future.Accompanied by Cuban leader Raul Castro, Xi flew to the Cuban "Heroic City," where he laid a wreath at the tomb of Jose Marti, a Cuban national hero and an important figure in Latin American literature.The Chinese president also visited the Moncada Barracks, where former Cuban leader Fidel Castro launched a failed assault on July 26, 1953, which is widely considered as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. The barracks have now been turned into a museum and a school city.Speaking at the July 26 Historical Museum, Xi noted that both China and Cuba boast a glorious revolutionary history and that "revolutionary martyrs are precious spiritual treasures that have inspired us to continuously march forward."Only those who remember history deserve a better future, stressed the Chinese president.In a friendly interaction with an enthusiastic crowd at the square in front of the municipal government, Xi said the Cuban people is a heroic people and Santiago de Cuba is a heroic city.Beijing, he added, is confident that under the leadership of President Raul Castro and the Communist Party of Cuba, the Caribbean country will make greater achievements on the socialist path that fits its national conditions.The two leaders also held a new round of talks to further exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern.Seeing Xi off at the airport, Castro said Xi's state visit to his country is a complete success, with the two sides reaching many new important agreements on further promoting China-Cuba relations.He also congratulated Xi on rounding off a fruitful visit to Latin America.For his part, Xi expressed his deep appreciation of the profound affection the Cuban Communist Party, government and people hold towards China, and conveyed his wish that bilateral relations will advance steadily and bilateral friendship will last forever.Cuba is the last leg of Xi's four-nation Latin America tour, which has already taken him to Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. While in Brazil, he attended the sixth summit of the emerging-market bloc of BRICS and a meeting with Latin American and Caribbean leaders.
