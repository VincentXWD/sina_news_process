Sino-Russia focus will set the foundation for peace and development worldwide, ambassador saysCloser cooperation and coordination between China and Russia will inject "positive energy" into the countries' relationship and pave the way for global peace and development, according to Li Hui, Beijing's envoy to Moscow.Li made the comment ahead of President Xi Jinping's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday while attending the seventh BRICS summit and a meeting of the Council of the Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation from Wednesday to Friday."China and Russia have repeatedly said they have no intention of seeking an alliance," said Li, China's ambassador to Russia. "But we are willing to sincerely help each other, together with other global partners, to safeguard peace, boost development and inject positive energy into modern international relations."It is the second set of talks for Xi and Putin this year. They previously met in Moscow in May to mark the 70th anniversary of Russia's victory in the Great Patriotic War, and they are scheduled to meet again in September in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.Other top-level Chinese and Russian officials in economy, finance, culture, education, defense and other sectors have already held regular meetings either in Russia or in China during the first half of the year.Apart from the close contacts, Li said Russia and China are working to achieve regional and global peace, and to allow developing countries to have a greater international influence.Li said that the five BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — have delivered more than half of global economic growth during the previous decade, and that there is a need to safeguard the collective interests of developing countries and increase their representation and influence in global affairs.During the previous 14 years, Li said the Shanghai council has acted as a "reliable platform" to safeguard the common safety and security of its members. And now, countries within the framework should take advantage of the opportunity to connect China's Silk Road proposals and Russia's Eurasian Economic Union initiative to deepen economic cooperation, Li said.China has attached great importance to the development of the organization and it is one of the country's foreign affairs priorities, Li said."We are advocating a new type of international relations, which aims for mutual benefit and win-win, and our all-around strategic partnership has given the interests of the other full consideration," Li said."The partnership has already brought tremendous benefits to the people of both countries, which are crucial for the world's peace, development and stability," he said.Li said the world has experienced rapid change, in which several powerhouses of development have formed worldwide. "The era in which one country has a decisive say over global affairs is over," Li said.He also responded to finger-pointing by some observers about a closer Sino-Russia relationship, saying China is determined to uphold its principles of peaceful development and bring opportunities, instead of challenges, to the world."At the same time, a prosperous and strong Russia is crucial in bringing peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region and the world," Li added.
