Russia and Vietnam are considering jointly developing offshore oil deposits in the South China Sea, RIA Novosti reported.“We are discussing cooperation on the shelf both here, in the South China Sea, and the possibilities of cooperation in other regions, including Russia,” Medvedev said during his visit to Vietnam. He was last in Vietnam in 2010 when being president.The Russian government has recently taken a decision to admit Vietnamese partners to a major hydrocarbon deposit in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area in the Russia Far North, Medvedev said.“This is a federal deposit and I can tell you frankly this decision was an exclusive one, considering our special relations with Vietnam,” Medvedev said.The Russian government decided in July 2012 to grant the license to develop the Severo-Purovskoye gas condensate field to Gazpromviet, a joint venture between Russian energy giant Gazprom and Vietnam’s PetroVietnam.Medvedev eyes more trade with VietnamMedvedev said during a trip to Hanoi that Russia wants to more than treble the value of trade with Vietnam as the two countries work towards a free trade agreement."We are pleased with the rapid increase in bilateral trade.
