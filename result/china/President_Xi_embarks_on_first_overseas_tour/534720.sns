Russia and China have clinched a preliminary agreement on the delivery of 48 Sukhoi Su-35BM fighter jets to the Chinese air force, the Voice of Russia reported, citing sources in Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation.The agreement worth 1.5 billion dollars may add to the Su-35 foraying into international markets even though Russia’s cooperation with China in this field is fraught with "substantial risks", said the Russian media.The Su-35BM is the modernized version of the T-10C platform that helped create the internationally distinguished Su-27 and Su-30 multi-role fighters.They have become the Russian-made warplanes of choice for foreign customers in the past twenty years.Remarkably, it was China that contributed to the Su-27’s breakthrough into the global markets. Between 1991 and 1996, Moscow and Beijing signed a spate of deals on the delivery of the Su-27SK and Su-30MKK fighters to the Chinese air force. A total of 26 SU-27SKs were supplied to China at the time.Shortly after, Russia inked similar agreements with India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Algeria and other countries.China gradually started to copycat production of the Su-27, something that finally led to the creation of the J-11 fighter, a replica of the Su-27 plane, said the report.Further, the Russian media said the copycatting added significantly to the development of China’s military aircraft industry and the modernization of the Chinese air force in the early 2000s.
