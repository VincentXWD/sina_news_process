By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishAn official of Russia’s Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation revealed China and Russia will co-build floating nuclear power plants and a joint venture might be established for the cause, the Voice of Russia reported, quoting a report by Russia-China Review published on Jan.10.The Rosatom official made the remarks at the recent launching ceremony of “Tianwan (Nuclear Station) Phase II" based in Jiangsu province.It’s reported that construction of floating nuclear plants will be based on nuclear-powered icebreakers and submarines.Russia is expected to achieve mass production of small nuclear reactors by 2014.Talking about the Tianwan Phase II, a Rosatom representative working on the project said the nuclear power plant was designed for a life of about 36 years, providing low-cost, safe and environmental-friendly energy for towns far away from cities.Fuels used in the construction can ensure its normal operation for 10 years, during which, its production capacity can meet the lighting and heating demand of a city with a population of 100,000.The project and its periphery construction will require an investment of 6 billion US dollars, costs of which will be recovered within 10 years.“Floating nuclear plants have a great advantage over those coal- or crude oil-driven reactors, which are difficult to build and hard to maintain a steady power output. Floating plants are even more cost efficient than diesel generators and they do no harm to the environment,” he said. “That’s why they are hugely popular both in Russia and abroad.”On the other hand, China desperately need clean energy as its ecological environment continues to deteriorate. Compared with the traditional nuclear power plants, floating ones have better anti-seismic performance and smaller chances of a radiation leak.Apart from this, floating plants can support a desalination of up to 24 million tons of seawater. That is very important to China, a country plagued by the lack of fresh water, he said.It’s learned that the only condition Russia set for agreeing to build floating reactors abroad is Rosatom must be in charge of all the construction, operation and staff training.Besides, cooperation with foreign countries won’t involve transfer of nuclear technology and used raw materials, which happen to be rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Non-Proliferation.
