I believe that with concerted efforts of all participants, the meeting will be a successful one and take the solidarity and cooperation of developing countries to a new high," he said upon arrival in South Africa.The BRICS countries account for 42 percent of the world's population, 20 percent of the world's economic output and 15 percent of global trade.
