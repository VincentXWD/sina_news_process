Syrian president appeals to BRICS for help

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday appealed to BRICS countries to help his unrest-stricken country restore security and stability.In a letter to those countries, Assad asked them to work together to stop Syria's two-year-long bloody conflict and facilitate a political solution.Al-Assad also urged the five nations to exert all possible efforts to alleviate the Syrian people's sufferings caused by the "unjust and illegal" economic sanctions.The appeal came a day after the Arab League, which suspended Syria's membership in November 2011, granted the long-vacant seat to the West-backed Syrian opposition, the National Coalition, and called on all countries to back it with all means, including military ones.The Syrian government rejected the pan-Arab body's move, warning it would have "dangerous" repercussions on the AL's future and the Arab national security as it would cause more bloodshed and encourage "terrorism and terrorists."The government also said it would "hinder the genuine efforts" exerted by caring countries and parties to "find out a political solution based on dialogue among the Syrians."BRICS countries, which group five emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have just concluded their fifth summit in South African city of Durban.The Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011, has killed more than 60,000 people and displaced more than 3 million, including some 1.1 million fleeing to neighboring countries.
