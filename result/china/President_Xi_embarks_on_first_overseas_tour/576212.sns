DURBAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff said Wednesday she was "very satisfied" with agreements reached at the Fifth BRICS Summit that has just concluded in the South African city of Durban."I am very satisfied with the decisions, which can help strengthen BRICS and consolidate its role in the global landscape," she said at a press conference at the end of the summit of BRICS, the acronym of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.President Rousseff said the meeting represents a new, important step toward the consolidation of the BRICS group of emerging economies that hopes to play an increasingly significant role in global decision-making.The president was especially pleased with progress toward the creation of the BRICS Development Bank.At the two-day summit, the leaders agreed to set up the development bank and to prepare for the establishment of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement among BRICS members."Today we took important steps towards the creation of a development bank, which must have funding compatible with its challenges. It is our contribution to the global economy in one of its most important features: development financing," she said."We have also today launched efforts to create a foreign reserve fund, which aims to strengthen cooperation and economic and financial integration of BRICS countries," the president added.While BRICS hope its development bank can serve to reduce members' reliance on the World Bank and the International Momentary Fund to finance development efforts, Rousseff highlighted the importance of reforming such multilateral organizations, saying "it is necessary to modernize them and make them more legitimate and representative of today's world.""2013 is a key year for implementing reforms at the International Monetary Fund to adapt it to the new reality of the global economy," the president added.The president also said BRICS must broaden cooperation in defense and fight against organized crime and drug trafficking.Calling BRICS' ties with Africa a strategic partnership, Rousseff said there is great potential for an "alliance between equals," adding that BRICS countries' expertise in infrastructure can help African nations overcome their development challenges.BRICS is Africa's second largest trading partner, said Rousseff, adding that BRICS-Africa trade grew tenfold in a decade to 330 billion U.S. dollars in 2012.The creation of the BRICS Development Bank means more opportunities for cooperation with developing countries, especially those in Africa, she stressed."For Brazil, it is extremely important to put investment, technical cooperation, technology transfer and other means of collaboration at the service of African countries," the president said, citing Brazil's sizeable population of African descent.The summit marked Rousseff's second official visit to Africa in 2013. She is expected to visit Africa for a third time this year to participate in an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the African Union, which will take place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
