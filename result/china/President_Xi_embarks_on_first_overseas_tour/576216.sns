President of the Republic of Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, said Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to his country will be historic."This is the first time that a Chinese president is visiting our country and it's a very important occasion for us," he told Chinese media on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Durban, South Africa, adding that he believes the visit would further advance the bilateral ties.Sassou said he and Xi will have in-depth discussions on the issues of economic cooperation, international issues of mutual concern, and Africa's peace and security."We shall therefore be discussing with the Chinese president about international politics because today, China plays a very important role on the international scene," he said.China and the Republic of Congo have achieved a lot in many sectors since the two countries established diplomatic relations in February 1964, said the president.The bilateral cooperation could be traced back to a long time ago and the two nations would celebrate the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties next year, he said.Asked whether the planned BRICS bank will be a better option to other international financial institutions like the World Bank, the Congolese leader believed that the new bank will reinforce the existing institutions."It's not just the World Bank, there is also the African Development Bank which has been massively funding projects in Africa. We do not have the means to do all that and if another institution comes to reinforce the existing ones in order to accelerate Africa's development, that is a good thing for the continent," he said.The Republic of Congo will be the final leg of Xi's first foreign trip as Chinese president, which had already taken him to Russia, Tanzania and South Africa.
