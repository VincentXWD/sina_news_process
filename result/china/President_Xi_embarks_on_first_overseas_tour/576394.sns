The just-ended fifth BRICS summit has strengthened cooperation and partnership among member states, China's assistant foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters here Wednesday.The meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, collectively known as BRICS, sent to the international community a message of unity, cooperation and win-win results, Ma said.The summit focused on the international economic situation, global economic governance, BRICS cooperation, and cooperation between BRICS and Africa.It was held against the backdrop of profound changes in the international situation and lingering economic uncertainties, as well as the increasing global clouts of the BRICS countries.The BRICS countries hoped, through the summit, to strengthen cooperation in all fields, enhance coordination on major international issues and reinforce their partnership, Ma said.FIVE ACHIEVEMENTSThe Chinese assistant foreign minister said five major achievements were made at the summit.First, it had enabled the BRICS countries to coordinate their positions on major international issues and regional hot-spots of common interest.BRICS countries pledged to back the United Nations's leading role in addressing global challenges and threats. They agreed that global and regional hot-spot issues must be solved via political and diplomatic means and dialogues, and in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.That showed the BRICS countries were playing a constructive role in promoting democracy in international relations and safeguarding world peace and stability, Ma said.Second, the summit witnessed new progress in practical cooperation among the BRICS countries.Leaders of the five nations agreed to establish a BRICS development bank and a contingent reserve arrangement, announced the establishment of a business council and a think tank council, and unveiled an action plan on further cooperation in nearly 20 fields, including finance, economy and trade, technology, health, agriculture, and people-to-people and cultural exchange.Such practical cooperation would fully tap the potential of BRICS cooperation, show the vitality of the BRICS countries, bring concrete benefits to the people of all member countries, and help consolidate the social and public basis for cooperation among the BRICS countries, Ma said.Third, BRICS countries reached a new consensus on improving global economic governance.The countries voiced support for Russia, which is currently chairing the Group of 20, in promoting coordination of macroeconomic policies, ensuring the strong, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy and in boosting jobs.The BRICS countries also called for reforming the international monetary and financial systems and increasing the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries.They noted in particular that the International Monetary Fund's quota and governance structure reform should be carried out at a faster pace, and the leadership selection of international financial institutions should be open, transparent and merit-based.That highlighted the BRICS' positive and constructive role in bringing more confidence to the recovery of the world economy and adding momentum to global economic governance, Ma said.Fourth, the summit decided to continue to promote global development.The BRICS countries called for an earlier fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which, they said, should be the basis for discussing the global development agenda beyond the 2015 deadline for MDGs.BRICS leaders stressed the importance of addressing the challenges confronting low-income countries in their development, and reaffirmed their commitments to safeguarding food and energy security and stabilizing commodity prices.They also expressed support for the results achieved at the UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20), and reiterated the Rio Principles and political commitments made for sustainable development and poverty eradication.All these commitments manifested the firm determination of the BRICS countries to bring benefits to the developing world and contribute to global development, Ma said.Fifth, the summit promoted the building of a partnership between BRICS and Africa.On the sidelines of the fifth BRICS summit, the first BRICS Leaders-Africa Dialogue Forum was held under the theme, "Unlocking Africa's potential: BRICS and Africa cooperation on infrastructure."The forum showed BRICS nations' readiness to enhance cooperation with African countries in infrastructure, to facilitate interconnections in Africa and unlock the continent's development potential, Ma said.These positive measures to forge a partnership with African states reflected the openness and inclusiveness of BRICS cooperation, he said.
