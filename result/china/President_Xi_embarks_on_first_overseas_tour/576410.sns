Chinese President Xi Jinping said here Thursday that China-Africa relationship will never cease its development and that China is ready to elevate and broaden its ties with Africa."The development of China-Africa ties can only be in present continuous tense, and never in present perfect tense," Xi said at a breakfast meeting with African leaders."We are ready to work with African countries to push our ties to a higher level and expand them to a broader area," said Xi, who arrived here Tuesday to attend the fifth BRICS summit, which was joined by African leaders for the first time.Xi noted that Africa is now in a new critical stage in its pursuit of peace and development.With a prospering economy and new efforts made in seeking strength from unity, Africa has achieved growing international standing. Meanwhile, it also faces many challenges, Xi said."I am confident that, as long as it maintains peace and stability, and actively explores a development path that suits its own conditions, Africa will undoubtedly embrace a brighter future," he said.The Chinese president said with the international situation undergoing profound and complex changes, China-Africa ties face unprecedented opportunities for development, as well as many challenges that come with new circumstances and new issues.No matter how the international landcape may change, China will stick to the friendly policy toward Africa, stay forever as a reliable friend and sincere partner of Africa, and strive to make greater contribution to the African cause of peace and development, Xi said.The Chinese president pledged China will be a steadfast guardian of Africa's peace and stability, a steadfast promoter of Africa's prosperity and development, a steadfast supporter in Africa's pursuit of strength through unity, and a steadfast advocate for Africa in its efforts to seek equal participation in international affairs."We are calling on the international community to work together to play a constructive role in Africa's pursuit of peace and development," Xi said.African leaders also spoke highly of the traditional friendship between Africa and China, voicing hopes of drawing on China's success of development and strengthening Africa-China cooperation.
