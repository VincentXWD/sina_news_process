The two sides have supported each other in the course of national development, and coordinated well in international affairs.The China-Africa relations have grown more vigorously since 2000, when both sides established the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to further their bilateral cooperation.At the FOCAC Beijing Summit in 2006, China and Africa decided to establish a new type of strategic partnership, which has deepened bilateral cooperation in all areas in recent years.The two sides are actively implementing the follow-up actions to the fifth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.China became Africa's biggest trading partner in 2009.
