President Xi Jinping said on Friday that China will always be a friend and partner for Africa, just before his week-long stay in Africa drew to an end.The president finished a state visit to the Republic of Congo on Saturday, the first by a Chinese head of state since the two countries established diplomatic ties 49 years ago.As he headed home, Xi says he will carry happy memories back with him and remember the smiles and sincerity of the African people.He had arrived in the central African country on Friday.Thousands of citizens, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with images of Xi and his Congolese counterpart Denis Sassou Nguesso, danced under a blazing sun to greet the Chinese delegation along the route from the airport.Their T-shirts carried the words in Chinese: "Friends from afar, please stay", the title of a famous Chinese song.China is currently the Republic of Congo's largest trade partner, and bilateral trade figures had jumped from $290 million in 2002 to $5 billion in 2012. According to official figures from China, 85 percent of employees from some 2,000 Chinese companies operating in 50 African countries are locals."No matter how the international situation changes, China will always be Africa's friend and partner in all weather," Xi said in a speech delivered later on Friday at the Congolese parliament.China will continue to increase aid to Africa within its capabilities, Xi added, saying China will also play a constructive role in bolstering peace and security in Africa.The president attended the fifth BRICS summit in South Africa earlier this week, and said he had met many African leaders during the trip and had extensive contact with African people."I have a very strong feeling that Africa is a continent full of vitality and hope," Xi said. "China-Africa cooperation has great potential and bright prospects."He said Sino-African relations need both "hard backing" in economic cooperation, and "soft propellants" like people-to-people ties to nurture the relationship.The president mentioned three Chinese nationals who saved 12 of their Congolese neighbors, including five children, when floods hit Brazzaville in December. He viewed it as a testimony to the deep-rooted ties between the Chinese and African peoples."I believe the China-Africa friendship will last forever, just like the unceasing flow of the Yangtze and Congo Rivers," he said.On Saturday Xi officiated the opening of a hospital and a library before flying home.The hospital, one of the most advanced in the region, can accommodate several hundred patients and will employ 260 doctors and nurses. The Chinese medical team working in the Republic of Congo will also be based there.Much of the equipment used in the hospital was bought from Europe, with China covering the costs of the project. It is among the 30 hospitals that Beijing had promised to build for Africa in 2006.In talks with Xi on Friday, Sassou Nguesso said China respects Africa, helps Africa, and does not interfere in the internal affairs of African countries.Sassou Nguesso said there are many critics who had described China's interest in Africa as "neo-colonialism", but that the African people are not misled by such allegations because they fully understand what true colonialism is throughout their own history.The African people support Africa-China cooperation, and hope China can play a bigger role in promoting peace, stability and development in Africa, he said.In response to Sassou Nguesso's summary of Africa's current situation, Xi said unity and cooperation would form the foundation for Africa's revival."Division would only lead to chaos, and chaos would plunge Africa backwards," Xi said.The two presidents also agreed to push for a joint effort in developing a comprehensive cooperative partnership of solidarity and mutual assistance. Xi said China would try its best to facilitate major bilateral cooperation projects, and encourage capable Chinese enterprises to participate in the construction of special economic zones of the Republic of Congo.This is Xi's first tour abroad since taking office as president, and it has also taken him to Russia, Tanzania and South Africa.
