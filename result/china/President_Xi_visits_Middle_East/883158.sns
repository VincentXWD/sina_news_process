President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran will highlight China's constructive role in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East, Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Ming said on Monday."President Xi will exchange views with leaders of the three countries on major international and regional issues to jointly advance peace and stability in the region and the world," Zhang said at a press briefing about Xi's visit from Jan. 19 to 24.During his visit to Saudi Arabia, Xi will hold talks with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to discuss lifting bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Xi will hold separate meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretary-General Abdul Latif Bin Rushid Al Zayani and the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Secretary-General Iyad Ameen Madani. The two sides will exchange views on promoting China's cooperation with the GCC and Islamic nations.During the visit to Egypt, Zhang said, Xi will speak at the headquarters of the League of Arab States (LAS), making clear China's policy and propositions on promoting peace and development in the Middle East. He will also put forward suggestions on deepening pragmatic cooperation between China and Middle East nations.During his visit to Iran, Xi will hold talks with Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, according to Zhang. China-Iran relations are facing important opportunities as interactions between Iran and the international community have grown markedly since the sealing of a comprehensive deal on the Iranian nuclear issue in 2015. The Chinese side will work with Iran to turn Xi's visit into a milestone in the development of bilateral ties."The Chinese side has maintained thorough communication with countries in the Middle East through various channels in a bid to ease regional tensions," Zhang said.He said China has called for the international community to support all parties on hot issues in the Middle East to resolve disputes and differences through inclusive dialogue.China has sent a total of 15,000 peace-keeping personnel to the Middle East over the past years. And China has dispatched 21 fleets to carry out escort missions in the Aden Gulf, where pirates have created problems."China will work with the international community to actively push for resolution of hot issues in the Middle East and make its due contribution to realizing peace and development in the region on the earliest possible date," Zhang said.Zhang said China is ready to provide assistance for relevant Middle East countries through friendly cooperation. Xi's visit will bear rich fruit in cooperation between China and the three countries. The results will cover energy, infrastructure, trade and investment facilitation, nuclear energy, space and satellite, and new energy."China calls for the international community to assist economic and social development in the Middle East so as to consolidate the basis for lasting peace," Zhang said.
