CAIRO, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday urged countries in the Middle East to resolve their differences through dialogue instead of use of force.Xi, who is here for a state visit to Egypt, made the remarks when delivering a speech at the Arab League headquarters."The use of force offers no solution to problems. Parties to the conflict should focus on advancing the process of political settlement," said Xi."The international community should respect the will and role of those directly involved, the neighboring countries and regional organizations, instead of imposing a solution from the outside," he added.Turmoil in the Middle East stems from the lack of development, and the ultimate solution depends on development, said Xi.The key to choosing a right path is to make sure that it suits the national conditions, he stressed, saying that when exploring for development paths, one will get nowhere by blindly copying others.Only by proceeding from one's own realities can the right path be found, Xi reiterated, noting that the development path of a country can only be determined by its people in light of its history, cultural traditions, and level of economic and social development.
