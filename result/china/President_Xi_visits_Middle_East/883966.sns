CAIRO, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping said here on Thursday that China supports the Arab world to solve its problems on its own.Xi made the remarks while meeting with Nabil al-Arabi, secretary general of the Arab League (AL) which is based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.The Chinese leader is on his first state visit to the North African nation, also the most populous Arab country.He said, as an important regional organization, the AL has made unrelenting efforts to help realize the independence of the Arab people, and plays a unique role in regional and international affairs.Xi hoped that the AL can continue to serve as a champion for advocating China-Arab friendship.China has always been a strong supporter for the just cause of the Arab nations as well as their efforts to handle regional crises on their own, Xi said.He urged the two sides not only to step up their mutual trust, coordination in major issues in the region and around the world, but also join hands in carrying out the "belt and road initiative," and promote mutually-beneficial cooperation.For his part, Arabi said China has always stood with the developing world, adding that the Arab world appreciates the publication of China's policy paper on Arab countries, and would like to work closely with China in political, economic as well as other sectors for mutual benefits.After Xi's meeting with the AL chief, he delivered a speech at the organization's headquarters.
