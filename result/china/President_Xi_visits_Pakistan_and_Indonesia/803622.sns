PRESIDENT Xi Jinping yesterday praised Pakistan for its contribution to security in China’s far west, while the south Asian country promised to step up cooperation in tackling terrorism.In an address to Pakistan’s parliament, Xi also called for closer economic cooperation between the traditional allies, a day after they launched energy and infrastructure projects in Pakistan worth US$46 billion.Xi has linked economic cooperation with security and said the two countries “share a common stake in security.”“Over the years Pakistan has overcome all kinds of difficulties and contributed greatly to the security and stability of China’s western border areas, and this is something that we shall never forget,” Xi told parliament.China is worried about separatists from Xinjiang, whom have launched a string of deadly attacks across China over the past year or so, and believes they have teamed up with Pakistan-based militants.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan considered Chinese security as important as its own.“We will fight together to eliminate the menace of terrorism. Our joint efforts against terrorism have succeeded so far, but we have to intensify the efforts to achieve our goals,” Sharif told parliament.The two countries are reportedly finalizing a long-discussed plan to sell Pakistan eight Chinese submarines.Sharif said Pakistan is looking forward to more defense cooperation with China.“Our defense ties are strong and they are poised to become stronger in years to come,” Sharif said.The economic projects launched on Monday are designed to establish a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor connecting Pakistan’s southern Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea and western China’s Xinjiang region.The corridor is a network of roads, railways and pipelines.The plan is part of China’s aim to forge “Silk Road” land and sea ties to the Middle East and Europe.Prior to his address at parliament, Xi attended the inauguration ceremony for a project named Green Parliament and designed to provide the Pakistani parliament house with solar energy, Xinhua news agency reported.Later yesterday, the Chinese president left for Indonesia to attend an Asian-African summit to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference.
