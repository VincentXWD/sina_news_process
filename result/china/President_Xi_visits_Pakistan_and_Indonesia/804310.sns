BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's three-point proposal to the ongoing Asian-African summit could set a new wave of global cooperation in motion.On Wednesday at the summit's opening, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed further Asia-Africa, South-South and South-North cooperation and called for a community of common destiny.Delegates from over 90 countries gathered at the summit in Jakarta of Indonesia, to explore new opportunities for cooperation.Xi said China is ready to work with other countries on the Belt and Road program, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and on the best use of Silk Road fund.Xi showed China's sincerity with practical concessions: zero tariffs for 97 percent of goods exported to China from the least developed nations with diplomatic ties to China; free training for 100,000 people from developing countries and free trips to China for 2,000 foreign youths.Faced with similar problems in improving their people's living conditions, developing countries, especially those in Asia and Africa, are eager to unite and grow stronger through cooperation. Through fresh platforms like the Belt and Road Initiative and AIIB, that cooperation can be deeper and more significant.During Xi's recent visit to Pakistan, contracts worth an estimated 50 billion U.S. dollars were signed on infrastructure and energy projects; a small step on the path of great ambition.Cooperation among developing countries cannot be exclusive. It must be open to all and needs the participation of all. The AIIB, potentially an open and inclusive multilateral lender, has 57 countries jostling to become founding members, including Germany and the United Kingdom.Having enjoyed fast development for over thirty years, China is ready to share its experience with its developing peers. The West should be just as eager to help those countries which lag behind to improve poor infrastructure, narrow wealth gaps and enjoy the fruits of modernity and civilization.A more secure and prosperous Africa and Asia is in the interests of China, the West and the world at large.
