Xi's Russia visit goes beyond trade

President Xi Jinping will attend Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Great Patriotic War. And for the first time a unit of the People's Liberation Army will take part in a parade in Russia.Xi started his Eurasia tour on Thursday with a visit to Kazakhstan, from where he flies to Russia and then Belarus. His visit to Russia is seen by many as a huge political support to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has been suffering the effects of Western economic sanctions and political maneuverings for its involvement in the Ukraine crisis.Leaders from more than 20 countries will also be present at the Victory Day parade in Moscow, driving home the point that non-Western economies now have a greater say in world affairs.The end of World War II marked the beginning of another war, the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, the postwar superpowers. And some observers say a similar situation could arise if China and Russia form a military alliance to challenge the US.But such a development is not possible because neither Beijing nor Moscow is willing to wreck the world order at the cost of global cooperation and peace. Moreover, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership is designed to protect the legal interests of emerging and developing countries, not to forge any form of anti-West alliance.Russia's Victory Day parade is not only a time to remember the sufferings and sacrifices of all the Allied countries in WWII, but also a wake-up call against former fascist forces to heed the lessons of history and for peace-lovers to stay dedicated to their cause. In this sense, deepening China-Russia cooperation is conducive to the two countries' time-honored friendship and rising call for peace and multi-polarization.To realize the great potential of bilateral economic exchanges, Beijing and Moscow have to cooperate closely and smoothly. The bilateral trade volume is expected to reach $100 billion this year, a goal that was almost achieved last year (more than $95 billion). Sino-Russian cooperation, as Xi emphasized at his meeting with Putin in Shanghai a year ago, should value quantity as well as quality in trade, energy, finance, aerospace and other exchanges.Apart from the Western sanctions, plunging oil prices have also taken a toll on Russia, one of the three largest oil exporters. As a result, its growth fell to about 0.6 percent in 2014. Hence, Russia's international economic cooperation in the next two years is critical to its foreign exchange earnings, financial market and economic structural adjustments.Likewise, with its economy having entered the "new normal", China needs to get more involved in regional exchanges and push for an inclusive Eurasian economic order. As founding members the Beijing-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China and Russia have agreed to work jointly to make trade and investments more convenient through multilateral organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Interestingly, major European countries do not want a complete halt in their trade with Russia because of the Ukraine crisis. Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not attend the May 9 parade, she will visit Moscow a day later to discuss the Ukraine crisis with Putin.Applying for the AIIB membership despite Washington's objection, many European Union countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and France, have made it clear that the fate of intercontinental cooperation should not be held hostage by geopolitical disputes.Incidentally, all the three countries on Xi's itinerary are crucial parts of China's Silk Road Economic Belt proposal, a nontraditional regional cooperative mode upholding mutual interest, win-win cooperation, inclusiveness and openness. And China means every word of the commitment it has made to maintain world peace and integrate Eurasia.The author is secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Research Center, affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
