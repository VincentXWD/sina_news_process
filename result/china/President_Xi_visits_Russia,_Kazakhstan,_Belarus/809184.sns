Better Sino-Kazakh ties to boost infrastructure blueprintChinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Kazakhstan on Thursday has consolidated bilateral ties that would boost the two countries' cooperation in infrastructure and China's "One Belt, One Road" development plan, observers said.Xi arrived in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Thursday afternoon on his second visit to the Central Asian country since he took office in March 2013, reported the Xinhua News Agency.The one-day visit to Kazakhstan was the first leg of Xi's week-long trip to Russia and Central Asian countries. After Kazakhstan, he will visit Russia from Friday to Sunday, before flying to Belarus on Tuesday, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Xi's visit to Kazakhstan was the first by a foreign leader since the country's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was re-elected last month.Xi will, together with Nazarbayev, discuss a development blueprint for China-Kazakhstan cooperation in many fields including the promotion of the Silk Road Economic Belt and coordinating the stand of both sides on a series of major programs, Vice-Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping said at a press conference on May 4.They will also have in-depth discussions on international and regional topics of common interest, Cheng added."Kazakhstan has been the leading country in economic cooperation and political exchanges with China among Central Asian countries. It has also been active in seeking cooperation with China's 'One Belt, One Road' plan," Zhao Huirong, a research fellow of Central Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.The initiative to boost regional trade with Central Asia, Russia and Europe was first proposed by Xi during his visit to Kazakhstan in 2013.Since Kazakhstan is one of the key countries in "One Belt, One Road," observers believe details on how the two countries can cooperate will be tackled by Xi and Nazarbayev.Kazakhstan's new economic policy, "Nyrly Zhol" (The Bright Road), which focuses on developing transportation, industry, energy, housing, utilities and social infrastructure, shares a lot of similarities and will complement China's "One Belt, One Road" strategy.The main road projects of The Bright Road will involve $9 billion in investments from 2015 to 2017."Kazakhstan has been moving toward modernization and industrial development. With its strategic location, Kazakhstan has acted as the transport hub in Eurasia. However, the country's scattered and incomplete transport network has impeded its development," Zhao told the Global Times.China, with its advanced technology in road construction, electrical grids and communication, can help Kazakhstan in advancing its infrastructure network.Since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1992, cooperation in trade and investment has witnessed a remarkable growth. China is becoming Kazakhstan's largest trading partner with trade expected to reach $40 billion dollars in 2015, reported Xinhua.Kazakhstan is also China's first investment destination in Eurasia, with its total investment in the country exceeding $26 billion.Diplomatically, Xi has also developed close ties with Nazarbayev since his 2013 visit through formal and informal meetings."The close personal relations between the two leaders will facilitate their Thursday meeting. For example, Nazarbayev, as Kazakhstan president, and whose country is a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), would be interested in discussing how the bank would benefit the country's infrastructure," Yang Xu, director of the Institute of Central Asian Studies of Lanzhou University in Gansu Province, told the Global Times.Xinhua reported there are currently more than 700 Chinese-funded companies and joint ventures in Kazakhstan, involving Chinese telecom giant ZTE, telecom equipment and services company Huawei, the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Those enterprises have created tens of thousands of jobs for Kazakhs.Sidebar: Xi's three-country tourKazakhstanDraw development blueprint for the China-Kazakhstan cooperation including the construction of the Silk Road Economic BeltDiscuss views on international and regional topics of common interestRussiaAttend events commemorating the 70th anniversary of Russia's V-DayMeet with President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry MedvedevMeet with representatives of World War II Russian veterans and representatives of Russian aid experts for China.Sign and release a joint statement on deepening bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership of coordinationBelarusAttend the opening ceremony of China-Belarus Local Trade and Economic Cooperation ForumVisit the Belarusian Great Patriotic War Museum and meet with war veteransInspect the China-Belarus Industrial ParkSign a China-Belarus treaty on friendly cooperationSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs
