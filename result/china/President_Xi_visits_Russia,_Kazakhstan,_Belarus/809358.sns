His daughter has been working in China Radio International for five years."I have been to China twice...many Chinese commodities are world-class, I myself use many Chinese products," he said, showing his Chinese brand mobile phone.Vyacheslav Leonov, director of China-Belarus Innovation Center, said that Chinese president's visit demonstrates that China has placed Belarus at an important position in its foreign policy.Leonov, also a member of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, has been to China for more than 20 times since his first visit in 2004.He said Chinese people have a lot of similarities with the Belarusians as both of them are kind, humorous and peace-loving."I have been following news on China...the 'Chinese Dream' proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping sets the great task of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," Leonov said.In addition, Leonov also mentioned that the two countries have progressed substantially on the cooperations of science and technology, such as manufacturing aerospace materials."We feel China's support to us on the international arena, which is important to a small country like Belarus, we are ready to open our heart to welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping," he said.
