CHINA has invited Russian troops to march in a parade in Beijing in September to commemorate the 70th anniversary of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, the defense ministry said yesterday.China has not given specific details about which other countries it plans to invite, but says it will likely invite representatives from the Western Allies who fought with China during World War II.President Xi Jinping attended a parade in Moscow on Saturday to mark 70 years since the end of the war in Europe.Fan Changlong, deputy chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, told Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow that China “warmly welcomes Russian military leaders and army formations” to take part in the September events in Beijing.Xi’s visit to Russia and appearance at the Moscow commemorations “pushed the China-Russia all-round strategic partnership relationship to a new level,” Fan said.Western leaders boycotted the Moscow parade over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis.The Beijing parade will likely see troops marching through the capital’s Tian’anmen Square.Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during their talks to strengthen military exchanges between the two countries.Shoigu noted that strengthening military cooperation between Russia and China is conducive to safeguarding world peace and stability.Russia will stay committed to deepening military exchanges and advancing military ties with China, Shoigu said.Yesterday marked the launch of joint naval drills by China and Russia which will last until May 21 in the Mediterranean Sea, signaling deepening relations and cooperation between the two countries.Nine surface ships from both navies will be involved in the “Joint Sea-2015” drills, the fourth since joint China-Russia sea drills began in 2012.The drills are to be staged in four phases, focusing on maritime defense, replenishment and escorting.The two sides were preparing detailed arrangements for the drills yesterday, and the ships are expected to leave Novorossiysk for waters in the Mediterranean today.“The joint drills are not aimed at any third party and have nothing to do with the political situation in that region,” a Russian defense ministry spokesman said.Geng Yansheng, a spokesman for the Chinese defense ministry, said earlier in the day that the drills will deepen friendly and pragmatic cooperation between China and Russia, and boost response operation capabilities in the event of security threats at sea.Geng said the drills will boost response operation capabilities in the event of security threats at sea.China and Russia have been working to strengthen the interaction and exchanges between the two countries’ armed forces in recent years.In addition to the annual naval drills, the two countries also conducted anti-terror drills and joint multilateral exercises under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization framework.As military ties are representative of state-to-state relations, military cooperation between China and Russia also symbolizes growing mutual trust, and is considered an important component of a comprehensive strategic partnership.According to a Xinhua commentary, the joint drills would go someway to show how closer China-Russia relations can contribute to a better world.Both countries plan to hold more celebrations this year to commemorate the end of the war and honor the fallen.
