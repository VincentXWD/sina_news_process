Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed Wednesday that the socialist path China has followed is "correct," and it is the choice of the "history and people."Citing the remarkable achievements China has made over the past 37 years when it initiated the reform and opening-up policy, Xi noted that it only took several decades for China to complete the journey the developed countries have gone through for centuries."That fully shows that the Chinese people are following a correct path," the president said while addressing a banquet hosted by Lord Mayor of the City of London Alan Yarrow on Wednesday evening.Meanwhile, he pledged that China will stay committed to a peaceful development path and does not accept the logic that a country will seek hegemony once it gets strong."No one and nothing -- in any reason -- can sway China's determination and will to pursue the path of peaceful development," he said.In his speech, the president also elaborated on the development of friendly relations between China and Britain, citing tea culture, literature, movies, TV dramas, football and cultural exchanges.He specifically referred to Shakespeare's influence on him by sharing the story of his youth time in the countryside, when he was obsessed with the master's works."The China-Britain friendship has been deeply rooted in the hearts of our two peoples. And there is a solid foundation in public opinion and in the society for the two countries to grow long-term relations," he added.
