Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at a dinner hosted by the Lord Mayor of the City of London at the Guildhall on Wednesday is visionary, both for China's development and China-Britain relations, said Britons who attended the dinner.Xi made a speech in such an important place in London history, and talked about so knowledgeably the culture of Britain, said Sherry Madera, minister-counsellor and director for financial and professional services with UK Trade and Investment in China.Xi highlighted in his speech one key part of China-Britain relationship, that is, a relationship based on people-to-people exchanges and enhancing of understanding between them, she said.Such a relationship can also help expand trade and investment between the two countries, and increase government-to-government and business-to-business exchanges, she added.Britain "has already seen the success of being open to China," she said, which has witnessed an annual growth rate of 85 percent of Chinese investment to Britain in the previous five years.George Osborne, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has expressed Britain's willingness to be the best partner of China in the West during his trip to China last month."So it really shows that this state visit (by Xi) has brought our thinking in alignment," Madera said."I believe perhaps those are experiences we can share in a new open environment and a new mutual understanding, on how we can work on trade and investment between UK and China," she said.Xi "is visionary, and has vision for China. It's to me the right route,"said Doug Barrow, chief executive at Maritime London."He was very real on what we can do together, and values the long and standard relationship between Britain and China," he said."Xi highlighted several points during his speech, like the right development path of China, Chinese dream and peace and development," he said, adding that what impressed him most is the "Belt and Road" initiative proposed by Xi, which will generate opportunities for the two countries"It's opportunity for Chinese companies and British companies to work together. We have already seen some successful cases," he said.Talking about China's economy, "Xi is really open on Chinese situation and its problem," he said, adding that Xi acknowledged the different views on Chinese economy."I have been lawyer trader for 30 years, and you learned how to trust someone or not, I'd like to trust your president," he said.
