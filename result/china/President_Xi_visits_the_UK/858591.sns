MANCHESTER, Britain, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping, a well known football fan, on Friday called for more exchange and cooperation between China and Britain on football as well as other sports.Accompanied by British Prime Minister David Cameron, Xi visited the Manchester City Football Academy, which is sponsored by the Manchester City Football Club, champion of the Barclay Premier League in 2013-2014 season.Xi and Cameron enjoyed an exhibition from the Manchester-based National Football Museum in which major historical artifacts, including the first World Cup ball, were on display, according to the official website of the club.Compared with other sports activities, football spreads in a wider range. Garnering the largest fan number, football has broad influence and is deeply loved by people all over the world, said Xi.A highlight of the visit was the inclusion into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame of former Manchester City player Sun Jihai, a Chinese player who played 130 times for Manchester City between 2002-2008, said the website.Sun was the first Chinese player to score in the Premier League and was last month named as the club's ambassador to China.In 2011, Xi outlined his three wishes to China's football -- to qualify for another World Cup, to host a World Cup and to win a World Cup championship.While China has yet to achieve those goals, a profound reform in this field has been carried out in the country.Hailing Britain as a football power and the headstream of modern football, Xi said China should learn from Britain in many aspects."Sports exchange is an important part of people-to-people exchanges. I hope the two sides could strengthen their cooperation in sports, including football, to improve people's health and China-Britain friendship," said the president.Xi is wrapping up his "super" state visit to Britain, the first one for a Chinese top leader in a decade.
