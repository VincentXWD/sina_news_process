Â by Xinhua Writer Gu ZhenqiuUNITED NATIONS, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he "most warmly" welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping to a UN summit on sustainable development and to the annual General Assembly high-level debate later this month.Ban lauded China's great contributions to the world efforts to carry out the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), voicing his hope to see the country's "hugely important role" in implementing the post-2015 development agenda, known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The secretary-general, in a recent group interview with the UN-based Chinese media, said that, "I most warmly welcome President Xi Jinping. He is coming for the first time in his capacity as president of the People's Republic of China.""I'm glad that President Xi Jinping is coming to participate in the special summit meeting on Sustainable Development Agenda and also the General Debate marking the 70th anniversary of the United Nations," Ban said."All world leaders and people will look for him," Ban said. "This will be a very important occasion where President Xi Jinping will gather together with world leaders to discuss the new development agenda to end global poverty, protect the planet and build a future of dignity for all. This year is truly a momentous year for the world, a chance to change the course of history from peacekeeping to sustainable development agenda, to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.""I sincerely hope that he will send out a very strong message, a message of hope to the people of the world."He expected China's continuing engagement in promoting the political stability, safety, and security around the world, including participation in peacekeeping operations."We also hope that China will always work with the member states as you have a very important role as one of the permanent members of the Security Council for maintaining peace and stability of the world."Ban was in Beijing on Sept. 3 for China's V-day celebrations. Xi told the UN chief that China is willing to work with the UN to safeguard the results of WWII and the UN Charter-based international order.China will stick to multilateralism and strengthen the role of the United Nations in safeguarding peace and achieving development, especially in peacekeeping and the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, said Xi.He also pledged China's support for the important role of the United Nations in climate change.Ban said that for years, China has been actively committed to world peace and development, especially to UN peacekeeping missions, hot regional issues and South-South cooperation. The world body is looking forward to strengthening cooperation with China in addressing climate change and other issues.On China's role in realizing the MDGs, a set of eight anti-poverty targets, Ban said China has been contributing a great deal."The MDGs are the most successful global vision to end poverty," he said. "In that regard, China has made a great contribution."The MDGs, with its deadline of 2015, will be replaced by the SDGs, which are to be approved by world leaders at the upcoming summit later this month. The SDGs will have 17 goals covering the whole spectrum of issues, including economic, social and environmental ones."I'm convinced that China can play a hugely important role in helping these Sustainable Development Goals be implemented," said Ban. "I sincerely hope that all the member states, including China, will reflect these 17 goals in their national social, economic and environmental policies, as their national growth plan."Meanwhile, the secretary-general also spoke highly of the Chinese efforts to fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions while tapping into renewable energy."Climate change is one of the top global agenda. We do not have much time to lose so we have to take urgent action," Ban said. "That is why climate change is one of the three top priorities for the international community to take action this year."
