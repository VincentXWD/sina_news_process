PARIS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China has "promoted innovative concepts based on human progress and peaceful development," French sinologist Pierre Picquart told an exclusive interview with Xinhua here prior to Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the UN headquarters."Beijing wants to turn the page of international relations which were too often based on hegemony," the French scholar said."Chinese President Xi Jinping also wants to promote win-win strategy and encourage the spirit of building a community of common destiny for the whole humanity," Picquart said, adding that the ideas would "foster mutual respect, equal treatment, peaceful development and common prosperity."At the invitation of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Xi will visit the UN headquarters and attend a series of summits from Sept. 26 to 28 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.Picquart believed the stability of the global system could be defined by the peace between the major powers.He said Xi attaches great importance to the UN because the Chinese president believes that everyone can help create a better world and that humanity shares a common destiny."To achieve this (a better world), Xi proposes to preserve the world order and the international system by focusing on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter," he said, adding that Xi also proposed to "establish a new model of international relations based on cooperation and win-win partnerships to promote peace and development in the world."Picquart believed that political decisions are required under the aegis of international organizations to realize the ideas and visions of the Chinese president."China's proposal for a stable, multipolar world is peaceful and within the framework of the UN system. In all international forums, China's diplomacy advocates multilateralism and it plays a decisive role."The French sinologist also hailed China's concept of win-win partnership. "Instead of seeing compromises in sharing gains, it proposes to find an agreement to increase the gains of each party.""For decades, China has played a decisive and very important role for peace, development and cooperation in the world. Through its all-round cooperation with the rest of the world, China assumes its responsibility in settling international problems," Picquart said.
