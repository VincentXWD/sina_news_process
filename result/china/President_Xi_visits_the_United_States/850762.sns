Xi Jinping kicked off his state visit to the United States on Tuesday and as well as the president the global media also focused on the first lady at his side.Peng Liyuan has accompanied her husband on 11 of his 15 official visits since he took office.Lu Peixin, former acting director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Beijing News that Peng's agenda would usually be arranged separately if she travels with Xi on a foreign visit.So what will she do this time?Interacting with the presidentDubbed by foreign media a "new source of China's soft power", Peng often becomes the focus of cameras the minute she exits the plane.Photos of Xi and Peng waving to the crowd during Xi's first state visit to Russia in 2013 were immediately spread on social media.Peng interacts with her husband frequently during visits. One example was the pair playing with a swing during a visit to India last September. On their visit to Trinidad and Tobago in 2013, Xi was seen holding an umbrella for his wife.Attending the state banquet and welcome ceremonyAccording to Beijing News, Peng will accompany Xi at a welcome ceremony and state banquet in the White House on Sept 25.Chen Mingming, a member of the Public Diplomacy Advisory Panel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it is basic etiquette and diplomatic practice for the first lady to attend welcome ceremonies and state banquets during visits to a foreign country.Peng won't attend large- and small-scale talks between Xi and US President Barack Obama or their meeting with the media.On the principle of reciprocity, Peng will attend a private dinner held by Obama if US first lady Michelle Obama attends.Visit to Lincoln High School in TacomaThe couple visited Lincoln High School in the port city of Tacoma, Washington State on Sept 23. They were welcomed by a special musical presentation in which dozens of students sang "What a Wonderful World" in English and the Chinese song "In the Field of Hopes," which is the signature song of Peng.Except for formal talks between bilateral leaders, there are no hard and fast rules on occasions where first ladies can accompany the presidents.Peng has attended many non-governmental events with Xi on previous foreign visits. She was seated in the audience when Xi spoke at a university during their visit to Russia in 2013. She also visited a farm with her husband in Argentina last year.Visiting a zoo with Michelle ObamaPeng and Michelle Obama will visit the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington on Friday and check out the zoo's newest panda cub to commemorate more than four decades of scientific collaboration between the US and China concerning giant panda conservation and make a special announcement.A pair of panda twins were born there to Mei Xiang last month, but one of the cubs died four days later.According to the White House, the two will be accompanied by students from Washington's Yu Ying Public Charter School, which offers Chinese language study to students.Separate activities in education and charityUsually, the couple divides their work during a visit, Chen said. The first lady often takes part in events related to children, education and charity to promote development in the fields and build a friendly national image for China.On Wednesday, Peng focused her attention on the global-health problems of HIV infection and tobacco use during a tour to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.Last September, Peng visited Tagore International School in New Delhi. She also met children with AIDS during a visit to the Republic of Congo in 2013. She was accompanied by the first lady of the country visited at such events.Peng also tries to promote China-made products during visits. In 2013, at the Women's Development Foundation in Tanzania, she presented China-made skin care products to the hosts, causing a buying craze for the brand among local customers."Women often have a gentler image", said Lu. "They play an important role in livening up the otherwise serious atmosphere during state visits".
