UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China has been taking a leading role in promoting South-South cooperation, said UN Under-Secretary-General Gyan Chandra Acharya on Thursday.Acharya, who is Nepalese, was also appointed to UN high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states in 2012.Responding to questions from Xinhua, Acharya said South-South cooperation is changing the global economic landscape in the areas like technical cooperation, trade ties as well as investment relationship."China has been playing a very important role right from the beginning. Over the past several decades because of the growing capacity and development, it has been contributing a lot. China has been taking a leading role in promoting the South-South cooperation," he said.Acharya noted sharing good practice and experience is an important part of South-South cooperation."So I'm sure that as we go towards the future, more efforts would be made by all," he said, adding that those who have more capacity need to help expand mutual benefits and solidarity of the countries of the South.A high-level roundtable on South-South cooperation, co-hosted by China and the United Nations, will be held on Saturday at the UN headquarters on the sideline of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which is going to adopt a post-2015 sustainable development agenda.Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to chair the high-level roundtable. The event is expected to provide a platform to exchange views and share insights on the ways in which South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation can contribute to the implementation of the agenda."This is a very important event," said Acharya, explaining that it comes at an important time -- in the process of the adoption of the sustainable development agenda and with the participation of many important figures including heads of state and government."And the Chinese president is taking the leading role. We are very appreciative of that," he said."I'm sure that this shall create momentum for the acceleration of the South-South cooperation to really promote a sustainable development agenda."Stressing that South-South cooperation is one dimension of international cooperation, Acharya said South-South cooperation complements North-South cooperation.And for the ambitious sustainable agenda, which aims to achieve wide-ranging goals including poverty eradication, education and health improvement, as well as economic growth, "it will not be possible to reach all these sustainable development goals without revitalized North-South cooperation as well as South-South cooperation," he said."So when you look at all the issues, every country has to collaborate with each other in order to make sure that we reach our goals," he said.
