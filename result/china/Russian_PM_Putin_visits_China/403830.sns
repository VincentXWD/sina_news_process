Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is set to arrive in Beijing today for a two-day visit, during which the two giants will sign billions of dollars in trade deals and seal a partnership to ensure mutual modernization.This will be Putin's first trip abroad since announcing in September his ambition to return to the presidency in Russia's 2012 elections after a power-swap agreement with incumbent President Dmitry Medvedev.A 160-member delegation, including top business leaders such as the CEOs of State-controlled energy firms Gazprom and Rosneft, will come with the prime minister.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that Putin will meet with President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and other Chinese leaders."Sino-Russian ties have enjoyed sound development in recent years. I believe Putin's visit will help push relations further," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov told the Kommersant daily on Monday that during Putin's visit, the two sides would sign some 20 business agreements worth $7 billion and reach a memorandum to cooperate on modernization."This is an answer to the Partnership for Modernization program that we have with the EU," Kommersant quoted a Russian foreign ministry source as saying. "The Chinese have long offered to create a similar program.""Expected to become president in 2012 and to rule Russia for 12 years (two terms), Putin will use this visit to consolidate ties with China," said Li Xing, a professor on Russian affairs at Beijing Normal University."A good partnership with Russia is also in China's geopolitical interests, considering recent tensions with ASEAN countries in the South China Sea," Li told the Global Times."The two countries will maintain their strategic partnership in many areas, such as on international issues, exemplified by their double veto last week of a UN Security Council resolution to condemn Syria," Li added.Reuters commented that the double veto was a warning against Western meddling in countries worldwide, and Putin may use the Beijing trip to show the West an emphasis on China as Russia's partner and a customer for its energy.Beijing will also use the opportunity to gauge Putin's plans for his possible two terms as Russian president, Reuters added.Meanwhile, Li forecasted "small fluctuations" in Russia's relationship with the US.If the Republican Party wins the general election next year, a power shift in the White House could "pose some unstable factors" to the reset of US-Russian ties, Li said, adding that the West has always favored Medvedev over Putin.Prior to Putin's visit, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan held talks with Zhukov on Monday at the 15th meeting of the Joint Commission for the Regular Meetings of Heads of Government of China and Russia in Beijing.Wang said the two countries would discuss building a special economic zone in Russia, expanding local currency settlements in trade, pushing forward key space cooperation projects and promoting infrastructure development.The two sides have the ability and confidence to realize the joint goal of seeing bilateral trade reach $100 billion by 2015 and $200 billion by 2020, Wang added.China has become Russia's top trading partner, and trade volume this year is expected to exceed $70 billion.Regarding energy cooperation, Liu said on Monday that Wang and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin would discuss the matter during talks in Beijing.Yuri Ushakov, a deputy chief of staff of the Russian government, told reporters on Monday that Putin has no plan to discuss a gas deal, on which the two sides have had major pricing disagreements.Media reports said that a potential deal could see Russian sell 70 billion cubic meters of gas to China each year.The Moscow Times on Monday quoted a Gazprom official as saying that the negotiations "might not end this year, pushing back initial deliveries beyond the latest target of 2016."A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said earlier that in the gas sector, "Russia's negotiating position has been seriously weakened by China's success in finding other partners, especially in Central Asia."Separately, Sergei Luzyanin, a deputy director of the Far East Institute of the Russian Academy of Science, told the Xinhua News Agency on Monday that both Moscow and Beijing are preparing for a possible second wave of the financial crisis that has beleaguered Europe.Both sides have begun experiments to reduce dependence on the volatile US dollar and to avoid becoming passive observers should another depression strike, Luzyanin said.Zhu Shanshan and agencies contributed to this story
