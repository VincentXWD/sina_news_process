BEIJING, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia pledged Wednesday to boost their cooperation when handling international affairs on the world stage."The two sides stress that the United Nations with its Security Council should play a core role in international affairs," said a joint communique inked by the two countries during Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's two-day official visit to China.The two sides said they will continue efforts to advance the multi-polarization of the world, make international relations more democratic and put international laws first in order to establish a fairer and more rational international political and economic order.According to the communique, China and Russia will strengthen their coordination on energy and food security, sustainable development, non-proliferation and other global issues within the framework of the United Nations, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and other international organizations.The two sides will continue working closely with each other to address the nuclear issue on the Korea Peninsular and other regional issues, said the communique.In the document, China and Russia said a timetable should not be set to reform the UN Security Council.It will not do any good toward reaching a consensus if some country or country bloc puts forward a reform suggestion without support of the majority of UN members, said the communique.The two sides said the East Asia Summit is an important forum for dialogue to safeguard security, development and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.They also pledged to boost their coordination in the Group of 20 (G20) to improve the global economic governance and the international financial system.In the communique, China and Russia said a special account will be opened and a development bank established to deepen practical cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and prompt development in the region in a harmonious way. ."The two sides are willing to cooperate more closely to advance the development of the SCO and make it an effective organization to safeguard regional security and an important means for sustained growth of SCO members," said the communique.
