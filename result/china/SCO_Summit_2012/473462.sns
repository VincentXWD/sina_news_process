Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives in China on Tuesday for a three-day visit aimed at bolstering a crucial alliance.Both energy and foreign policy cooperation are high on the agenda, with Putin also participating in a regional summit Wednesday and Thursday where he will separately meet the presidents of Iran and Afghanistan.Putin's China trip is his first to Asia since starting an historic third term last month.The Russian delegation includes six cabinet members, the heads of Russia's energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and Transneft, and "all the major names of Russian business," Ushakov said.While energy is high on the agenda, a long-awaited gas deal that could see Russia annually supply 70 billion cubic metres of gas directly to its neighbour will not be signed due to pricing disagreements, Gazprom said on Monday.(Agencies)
