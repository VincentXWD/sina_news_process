Its first ruler was Haidu-Khan.The Mongolian state was established in 1206 when the Mongolian tribes were united by Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan remained a ruler of Mongolia from 1206 until 1227. The Mongolian state has considerably expanded, having incorporated territories of China (Ulus of Great Khan), Central Asia (Chigatay Ulus), Iran (Ilhan Empire) and Russia (Ulus Juchi or Golden Horde). However, due to significant differences in culture in the seized lands, the state was non-uniform, and soon started disintegrating.Mongolia became independent again in 1911 after the Xinghai Revolution in China with its capital in Urga. Then the dictatorship was established in Mongolia by Russian Baron Ungern. In 1921, Mongolia got its own national government.
