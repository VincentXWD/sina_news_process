Photos taken on May 24, 2011 showed the partially dried-up Honghu Lake in Honghu City, central China's Hubei Province. Plagued by a severe drought which is spreading throughout China's southern regions, Honghu Lake has dwindled by a third in water surface and dropped down to less than 40 centimeters in its deepest place.
