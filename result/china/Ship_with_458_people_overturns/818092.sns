BEIJING - The capsized Eastern Star cruise ship will be moved to allow divers to search for victims at the site.With eight victims still missing, the search and rescue headquarters will move the ship as soon as weather and water movements are favorable, Minister of Transport Yang Chuantang said Monday."A glimmer of hope deserves all-out efforts," he said.Ministry sources said on Saturday the search for the missing victims would be extended for nearly 1,300 km along the Yangtze River between Jianli in Hubei Province, where the ship sank, downstream to the Wusong Estuary in Shanghai.The Eastern Star with 456 people onboard was on an 11-day trip along the Yangtze when it was overturned by a tornado last Monday night.Fourteen people survived the disaster. As of Monday, rescuers had retrieved the bodies of 434 victims.Shipwreck survivor also survived Wenchuan quakeThey say cats have seven lives, and it seems some people are twice lucky, too. Yu Zhengwei, a vendor on the capsized ship Eastern Star, survived not only the cruise tragedy that claimed the lives of more than 400, but also the Wenchuan earthquake that left more than 80,000 dead in 2008.Wang Shengcai, a villager from Fuxing village, Sanzhou county, Jianli county, which is about 20 km away from the accident site, found Yu lying on the bank of the river in the early morning on June 2.Wang took Yu home and called the police.According to Yu, his wife and he had a contract with the ship company to sell food and snacks on the vessel. They had worked on the ship for three trips before but this time the disaster struck.At the night of the accident on June 1, which incidentally happened to be his 44 birthday, Yu went on the deck to collect his clothes he had left there to dry when heavy storm and rain hit the ship. Suddenly the vessel leaned sharply and he was thrown away.Luckily, he was able to grab a life buoy and held on to it tightly until he was found seven hours later.Yu went back to Chongqing while his two relatives stayed in Jianli for any news about his wife.Two passengers found their fates tied to one life buoy when theEastern Starcruiser sank in the Yangtze River.Hu Jianyue, 56, who was watching people playing mahjong on the third-floor deck of the cruiser, was thrown into the water when the ship overturned and sank on Monday night.Hu felt a life buoy in the darkness and grabbed it. After floating for a while, he found a companion."When a man put his hand on my life buoy I was terribly nervous," said Hu. "I feared he might take it away from me. But the stranger also looked nervous"."One life buoy for two people, it was dangerous if we fought for it," said Xie Yong (alias), a 63-year-old who was also thrown into the water. "So I just kept silent."The two floated on the river together and "shouted for help in turn when seeing boat near".Three hours later, they were rescued up by a passing boat.Zhang Shunwen, 52, captain of the shipWith wind at around three to four grade (about 12-28km/h) on the Beaufort scale, the captain tried to steer the ship but was unable to control the vessel and it capsized, according to a Xinhua report.Zhang Shunwen said as the wind was coming from the South, he first tried to steer the ship northward on the leeside in an effort to counter it with the vessel's speed.However, the wind suddenly gathered speed and he lost control of the cruise."We couldn't fend off the wind even if the wheel was hard aport." The hard aport is a nautical term that means a turn all the way over as far as the helm will allow in the direction of the port side of the vessel.Zhang escaped alive and is in police custody, although he has not yet been accused of any wrongdoing.Born in 1963, Zhang has been working for 35 years and became captain of the ship in 2007. Until the incident, Zhang was regarded as an effective captain and his experience as a sailor was flawless with numerous awards.Zhang's wife was also an employee on the ship and she remains missing, according to China News Service.Yang Zhongquan, 45, chief engineerYang Zhongquan said he had just gone back into the cabin after inspecting the deck when the water flooded into the engine room and the lights suddenly went out."I felt the ship topple over,"Yang was quoted by Xinhua.In 2011, Yang was rated as a "five-star chief engineer" by the Changjiang Maritime Safety Administration.Following are more stories from other survivors.Wu Jianqiang, 58, tourist"I might have died if my wife had not let go of my hands at the last moment," said Wu Jianqiang, who was the first person to call the police after the accident on Monday.Wu and his wife, Li Xiuzhen, are from Tianjin. The two were aboard the Eastern Star for a package tour when the ship sank.According to Wu, the couple was lying in bed holding hands together when the ship tilted. The bed then fell and trapped Li Xiuzhen.Wu tried to pull his wife out but failed. "Let go!" Li shouted suddenly to Wu.Shocked by his wife's request, Wu loosened his grip on his wife's hands and was then pushed outside by water. The ship was turned over completely at that moment.Wu then swam for several minutes before he was saved.His wife remains unaccounted for.Three of the 14 survivors recall their experiences of the maritime disaster on the Yangtze River, in which 18 are confirmed dead and hundreds remain missing.Xie Lin (alias), 52, touristÂ Xie Lin never imagined his smoking habit, which his wife often complained about, would someday save his life.On Monday evening, Xie, on a 12-day package tour with his wife, was invited by other passengers to play cards. But later the game was canceled and Xie decided to go to bed early.He then went out to the deck for a cigarette since smoking was prohibited inside the cabin. His wife had already fallen asleep.When he went back about 10 minutes later, the ship began to tilt."A huge stream of water propped me up and I couldn't control my body,"Xie recalled, "but I thought to myself that I wanted to see the sky and had to get out."Xie grabbed a life ring as his body struggled to remain above water and put his feet in a plastic bucket. "I thought anything plastic should somehow be buoyant."Later Xie found another survivor and the two were finally saved by a boat after hours of floating in the cold water and rain.Xie called his son in Shanghai and told him "your mother is gone"."The dead are dead and the survivors should go on living and make the most of every day," Xie said. He said he doesn't want to recall the experience any more, not even to his son.Zhu Hongmei, 65, touristWhen the shipwreck happened, Zhu Honemei, a 67-year-old Nanjing native, was trapped at the bottom of the boat. Later when the ship capsized she luckily had her head above water.Then Zhu climbed onto a cabinet and found an iron stick. She began to hit the hull with the stick.She was pulled out of water 17 hours after the accident."My husband was also on the ship but I was unable to find him,"Zhu said.Zhang Hui, 43, tour agency staff member"The weather suddenly became stormy outside, with strong lightning and heavy rain pouring in from the right side of the ship. Even when we shut the window, we noticed water coming into the cabins," Zhang Hui, one of the tour agency staff members, recalled from a hospital bed on Tuesday in Yueyang, Hunan province, where he was rescued.Twenty minutes later the ship tilted about 45 degrees, and Zhang said to his colleagues that they were in "deep trouble". Seconds later, the ship began to capsize.Zhang, who can't swim, immediately reached for a life jacket. By the time he put it on, the cabin window was already above his head and the water level was rising inside the ship. He and his colleague climbed out the window and jumped into the river.But many others who were on board the cruise ship Eastern Star had no chance to put on life jackets because the ship capsized so quickly, Zhang said."I could hear people screaming for help around me," Zhang said.He started to float on the river, and big waves caused by the storm hit him several times. It was just before dawn when he saw the riverbank. After using the last of his strength to climb onto the shore, he discovered he was in neighboring Hunan province."I am alive" is the first thing he said when he called his wife.
