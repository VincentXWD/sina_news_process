BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China said Sunday that the Philippines' allegation that a Chinese ship "bullied" Philippine vessels was sheer subjective assumption."According to the information from relevant authorities, China's Yuzheng 310 went on patrol in waters off the coast of Huangyan Island in the early morning of April 28 (Saturday) in accordance with the law," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin in response to a question from the press."The Philippine side's allegation about the Chinese fishery patrol ship 'bullying' Philippine vessels is sheer subjective assumption," said the spokesman.On Saturday, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said that the Chinese ship approached several Philippine vessels and generated a two-meter wave to bully them."The Huangyan Island is an inherent part of China's territory and we hope that the Philippine side will stop creating incidents that make things even more complicated," he added.
