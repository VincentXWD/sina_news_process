China's National Meteorological Center (NMC) is continuing its second highest level alert for parts of southern China battling freezing temperatures and icy rain, as more bad weather is expected. The NMC Thursday forecast freezing rain, which quickly turns into ice on the ground, for central and northern Guizhou Province, western Hunan Province and the northeastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
