CHANGSHA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of travellers were stranded Tuesday in central China's Hunan Province as heavy fog delayed dozens of flights for hours and paralyzed road traffic.Visibility dropped to less than 10 meters in downtown Changsha, capital of Hunan, Tuesday morning, forcing authorities at the city's Huanghua International Airport to suspend 44 flights, including one departing for Hong Kong, according to airport officials.Road traffic flows slowed and congestion was reported in many parts of the city. A four-vehicle pile-up on a section of a provincial expressway left many vehicles stationary for about half an hour.No casualties were reported in the accident, said an official with Hunan's expressway administration.The fog began to disperse at noon and airport authorities are readjusting flight schedules. About 20 flights had taken off or landed by 1 p.m..
