The real-name train ticket policy is applied to all trains in China from January 1, 2012. This policy has been applicable to high speed and bullet trains since June, 2011. It is expected to relieve the difficulty in buying train tickets and effectively eradicate scalpers who profit a lot in trading train tickets especially during the Spring Festival travel rush. Passengers should buy train tickets and get on trains with the presentation of their own valid ID certificates.
