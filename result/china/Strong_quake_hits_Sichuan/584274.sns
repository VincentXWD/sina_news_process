By Jia Xiaoguang, Sina EnglishChen Ying, a reporter who has been acclaimed as “the most beautiful bride” by Chinese netizens for her on-scene reporting of the deadly Ya'an earthquake on the day of her wedding, is alleged to have refused the cancellation of the wedding and masterminded the ensuing episode as a personal hype.Photos going viral on China’s Internet show Chen Yin, still clad in her white wedding gown, is doing a report in the midst of the deadly temblor that hit Ya’an in southwestern Sichuan province on Saturday.Her “professional spirit” as displayed in the photos has since touched many Internet users, who then praised her as “the most beautiful bride”.Dissenting voices however have risen amid the nearly unanimous laud, as some whistle-blower downplayed the whole event as a merely publicity stunt that has even put others' interests at risk.A netizen surnamed Wei revealed in an online post that Chen insisted upon holding the wedding though advised otherwise for safety concerns by the hotel staff.“We fled to the parking lot of the Hongzhu Hotel after the quake erupted only to find that a wedding was going on there.” said Wei.“The bride rejected the cancellation of the wedding, requested the staff to perform the welcoming ceremony as in ordinary days and even cordoned off the parking lot for her own vehicles.” Wei proceeded with his recount.A man in charge of the hotel bore testimony to Wei’s description during an interview, adding that the demand of holding the wedding was made by Chen Yin and her relatives and friends.The chef then prepared the banquet on the ground outside the hotel building for the sake of safety, and Chen and her family came to terms with the compromise plan, he said.
