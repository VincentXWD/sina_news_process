By Yu Runze, Sina EnglishA 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted southwest China's Sichuan Province on Saturday morning, killing at least 193 people.Following the quake, donations and aid from individuals and enterprises flooded in to help the victims. Among the enterprises that offered help, Yili and Mengniu, two famous Chinese dairy companies, stood out.Mengniu Dairy Group announced Saturday morning, 3 hours after the quake, that it will donate 10 million yuan in cash and 10, 000 cartons of milk to the quake-hit-area.Following Mengniu’s announcement, Yili Dairy Group said it will deliver milk powder, worth 1 million yuan, to the quake vicitims for there was a lack of milk powder for babies in the region.However, their kindness offering was not appreciated by netizens. Thousands of microbloggers mocked their donations.“Watch out Ya’an,” tweeted Hong Huang, a public figure.“How can you donate milk? Probably you cannot sell out your milk,” a comment read.“The kids are innocent,” another netizen mocked.The two dairy firms have made great efforts to win back their reputation tarnished in a series of quality scandals including the infamous melamine incident.Fortunately for two milk giants, the Chinese Red cross is also on the way to recover from a series of scandals that began after the Sichuan earthquake in 2008.Following Saturday's Sichuan earthquake, the appeal from the Chinese Red Cross, China's largest charity, seemed fairly straightforward."The quake zone urgently needs tents, quilt, instant food, drinking water and medical goods," the charity posted to Weibo, a twitter like service in China. "Please try your best to donate cash."In response, hundreds of thousands of people quickly posted emoticons giving the government-run charity a literal thumbs-down."People around me are all hesitating whether to donate to the earthquake zone," wrote online user Li Yapingww. "They don't know if their hard-earned money can reach the victims."According to Chinese media, over $12.4 bn US dollars (￡8.1 bn) in goods and services were donated to quake victims in the year after the 2008 Sichuan quake.However, the charity's reputation was soon tarnished. Some monitoring the quake's rebuilding efforts accused Red Cross officials of misusing donations by purchasing needlessly expensive tents and vehicles, though those allegations were denied.In April 2011, revelations of an extravagant banquet attended by Red Cross officials costing almost 10,000 yuan ($1,600; ￡1,050) spurred criticism online. The amount is considered high within China, especially for employees of a charity. Officials apologised and offered to foot part of the bill themselves.Months later, the organisation was decimated by a much bigger scandal when a glamorous young woman calling herself "Guo Meimei" posted online photos of herself posing with luxury cars and designer handbags.Ms Guo boasted that she was the "general manager" of the China Red Cross Commerce Department - a commercial organisation with murky links to the charity.It turned out that Ms Guo had inflated her own title, but the damage had already been done: many donors had scrutinised the photos of Guo's extravagant lifestyle and had concluded that the Red Cross was wasting their money.
