Households in the earthquake-hit areas of southwest China's Sichuan Province can access electricity again three days after a 7.0-magnitude quake cut power supply for thousands of homes in the region.An emergency office of the State Grid Corporation said on Tuesday the company has repaired electricity transmission lines and restored power supply to 179,600 households in the city of Ya'an.Some 7,000 households still do not have electricity due to the powerful quake that caused a power failure to 186,600 homes.Electricity supply to all 45 quake relief command venues and makeshift medical centers, as well as 90 settlement locations for victims, is being provided, the company said.The National Energy Administration (NEA) also said Tuesday that 22 of the 34 large substations shut down by the quake have resumed operation, while 177 of 264 damaged electricity lines have been restored.Oil and gas pipelines in the region are working normally, but the production from coal mines in the city has been suspended, according to NEA.The quake has killed at least 193 people, left 25 others missing and injured more than 11,000 people.
