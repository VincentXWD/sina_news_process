The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) will subject itself to a renewed investigation into the case that landed the charity in a trust crisis two years ago, the social supervision committee of the RCSC announced Wednesday.The announcement came as the public has been hesitant to donate quake-relief money via the RCSC after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook China's southwest Sichuan Province on Saturday. This reluctance underlines the organization's urgent need to rehabilitate its image.The reputation of the RCSC took a major hit two years ago, when a young woman calling herself Guo Meimei used social media to say she was a manager in the organization and openly flaunted wealth and extravagance.
