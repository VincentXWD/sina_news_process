The Red Cross Society of China is to reopen an investigation into the Guo Meimei affair as the country's biggest charity organization finds itself still mired in a credibility crisis two years after the scandal.The probe is to begin after the current crisis in Sichuan Province following Saturday's devastating earthquake.In 2011 Guo claimed to be a manager with the charity and flaunted her lavish lifestyle online, sparking a public outcry and questions over how donations were being handled.Following the controversy, a 16-member committee was established by the Red Cross in December last year to supervise the collection and management of donations.An investigation following the "Guo Meimei incident" had found that neither Guo nor her wealth had anything to do with the Red Cross.However, the investigation concluded flaws existed in the management of one of the organization's fundraising groups."Now the Red Cross is focusing on the rescue works in Sichuan and the investigation will be reopened after the rescue is finished," Wang Yong, a spokesman for the committee, told The Beijing News.The new investigation will kick off in late May, according to Xinhua news agency.As rescue and relief efforts continue in Sichuan, the charity has been under fire online.Under a post by the Red Cross, one person commented: "Get lost! I don't want to see my hard-earned money contribute to another luxury bag for Guo so she can show off to the world." Another wrote: "I would not donate a penny to the Red Cross as I don't trust it anymore, no matter what it tried to explain."Independent probeWang said: "Despite the work the RCSC has done in quake relief, its efforts were not recognized by the public. Instead, many people still take the 'Guo Meimei' case as a proof of the RCSC's corruption and embezzlement of public funds, which hampers the organization's future work in disaster relief and aid."The new probe will be independent and carried out without the participation of Red Cross staff, Wang said, adding that it will be led by the committee and conducted by third-party professional agencies.The committee will also invite celebrities with a good public reputation to take part in the investigation, and will publicly disclose its process and results, Wang said.The committee has no affiliations with the charity, Wang said.The committee members - all professionals in the fields of law, finance, medicine, communication, social management and rescue-and-relief - work on a voluntary basis.They receive no pay or remuneration of any kind from the Red Cross, Wang said.The committee can initiate investigations into any Red Cross-related matter that is questioned by the media or the public, and it will publish its results without interference, Wang said.Following Saturday's earthquake that claimed at least 196 lives, online reports show that donation collection points set up by the Red Cross on streets had been shunned by passers-by.However, private charities such as the One Foundation initiated by movie star Jet Li had been widely applauded for their transparency and orderly handling of donations.Many individuals and companies were choosing to donate to non-governmental organizations, such as the One Foundation, as an alternative to giving to the Red Cross.
