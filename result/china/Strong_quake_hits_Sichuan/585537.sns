Rescue troops in earthquake-hit areas are trying hard to help provide local residents' daily essentials such as drinking water, bathing facilities and heated food, by sharing their field equipment with civilians, according to military sources.Since April 21, one day after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Lushan in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the logistics department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Chengdu Area Command has sent some 20 water-purifying vehicles, mobile bathing facilities and rolling kitchens into the field, for those who have lost their homes.Currently, the troops have set up five temporary drinking-water-supply stations and four bathing facilities in the worst-hit Lushan and Baoxing counties.So far, the troops have provided locals with 440 tons of purified water, which has benefited some 21,000 people, while over 6,000 civilians have received heated food from the PLA.
