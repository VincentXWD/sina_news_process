It set up lightning protection facilities at relocation sites after the Wenchuan quake in 2008 and it is doing the same in Ya'an, Chen said.According to Tang Chuan, from the geo-hazard department at Chengdu University of Technology, Wenchuan experienced a number of landslides during the flood season and Ya'an, with traditionally heavier rainfall, is more likely to be hit.DonationThe Red Cross Society of China raised 566 million yuan ($92 million) as of April 27, almost half the total national fund raising of 1.37 billion yuan.Most of the donations to the Red Cross came from private enterprises and individuals, it said.Zhao Baige, executive vice-president of the organization, said she was grateful that the public still has confidence in the Red Cross despite concerns over fundraising.The organization is releasing information on how donations will be spent, she said.People and organizations from all walks of life are lending a helping hand.Three trucks loaded with relief materials, including tents, rain gear, electric generators and food, have arrived in Lushan county, the quake's epicenter.The materials were donated by the EMBA association of Sichuan University's business school.Â
