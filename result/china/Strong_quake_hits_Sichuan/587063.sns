Some Hong Kong people opposed a plan Wednesday to donate money to Sichuan provincial government for earthquake victims, underlining widespread public concerns about mainland corruption.The city's leader, Leung Chun-ying, proposed donating 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($13 million) to the Sichuan provincial government for relief efforts following an earthquake Saturday that struck Lushan county, killing at least 192 people and injuring more than 11,000.Hong Kong lawmakers said they wanted to help the victims but opposed giving money to government officials because of fears about corruption and misuse of funds. They said they would prefer that the money be channeled to aid groups and non-governmental organizations.Other legislators also voiced their opposition to the donation at a special meeting of the finance committee, which ended before they could vote on it. It's unclear whether another meeting would be held.(Agencies)
