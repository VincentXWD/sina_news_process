SHANGHAI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday pledged "zero tolerance" for terrorism, separatism and extremism in carrying out security cooperation among Asian countries.Xi made the pledge in a key-note speech on a new Asian security concept delivered at the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia held in east China's Shanghai on Tuesday and Wednesday."We should strengthen ... international and regional cooperation, and step up the fight against the 'three forces,' in order to bring a life of happiness and tranquility to the people of this region," Xi said.In his speech, Xi stressed the importance of safeguarding the comprehensive security of the region, which means upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields.Asia's security challenges are extremely complicated, which include both hotspot and sensitive issues and ethnic and religious problems, he noted.The challenges brought by terrorism, transnational crimes, environmental security, cyber security, energy and resource security and major natural disasters are clearly on the rise, Xi said."We should take into full account the historical background and reality of Asia's security issues, adopt a multi-pronged and holistic approach, and enhance regional security governance in a coordinated way," he said."While tackling the immediate security challenges facing the region, we should also make plans for addressing potential security threats, and avoid a fragmented and palliative approach that only treats the symptoms," the Chinese president added.
