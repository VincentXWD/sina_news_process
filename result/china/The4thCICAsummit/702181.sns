SHANGHAI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on Asia to build "sustainable" and "durable" security, noting the need to focus on both development and security.For a tree to grow tall, a strong and solid root is required; for a river to reach far, an unimpeded source is necessary, Xi said in a keynote speech at the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), quoting a Chinese saying.Xi noted that development is the foundation of security and security constitutes the precondition for development.The tree of peace does not grow on barren land while the fruit of development is not produced amidst flames of war, the Chinese president continued.Referring to a "new Asian security concept", Xi said that for most Asian countries, development means the greatest security and the master key to regional security issues.To build an Asian security mansion that could stand the test of wind storms, Xi said, "we need to focus on development, actively improve people's lives and narrow down the wealth gap so as to cement the foundation of security" ."We need to advance the process of common development and regional integration, foster sound interactions and synchronized progress of regional economic cooperation and security cooperation, and promote sustainable security through sustainable development," the president added.China took over the CICA presidency from Turkey at the summit.
