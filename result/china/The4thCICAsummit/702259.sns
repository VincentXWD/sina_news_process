Performances included intangible cultural heritage such as Chinese opera, embroidery, painting and so on. First ladies were also invited to taste Chinese cuisines during the performances.Hearing that Su Huiping, the heritor of Gu Embroidery can separate one silk thread to 240 threads to sew fish’s tail and bird’s wing, one of Peng’s guests asked: “Can you show us threading needles?” When Su threaded a needle with a super thin thread that she separated out, Peng and her guests all applauded.
