Mao Zedong Thought is a scientific ideological system developed by a group of earlier revolutionaries of the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong. Based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, the system summarizes the rich and unique experiences that China has gained through its long-term practice of revolution and construction. It well fits China's specific conditions.Mao Zedong Thought is an integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. It is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China. Facts have proven it to be the correct theoretical principles and summary of experiences on China's revolution. Mao Zedong Thought truly reflects the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China.The living souls of Mao Zedong Thought are its standpoint, its views and its methods that have been fully adopted and used in each and every period of China's revolution and construction. They include three basic aspects: Seeking truth from facts, pursuing the mass line, and sticking to the principle of independence.Seeking truth from facts is the essence, the root and starting point of Mao Zedong Thought. It is the key ideology of the Communist Party of China. Seeking truth from facts means that we must proceed from reality and put theory into practice in everything. In other words, we must integrate the universal theory of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific conditions. Pursuing the mass line requires that we work on everything for the people, by the people, from the people and to the people. Sticking to the principle of independence and self-reliance is the necessary outcome we achieve by depending upon China's reality and relying upon the masses in our revolution and construction.Mao Zedong (1893-1976) is one of the founders of the Communist Party of China and the core figure of New China's first generation leadership.
