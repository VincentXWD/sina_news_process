He has been keeping Tianjin's streets clean for 23 years, now Xu Wenhua has swept his way to become to a CPC delegate at this year's National Congress of the Communist Party of China.Working as a sanitation worker for 23 years in Tianjin municipality, Xu has cleaned some 70,000 kilometers of streets, more than 1.5 times the length of the equator.His hometown is in Jingxian county, Hebei province, but he has never got the chance to spend Spring Festival, China's Lunar New Year, together with his family as it is usually the toughest time to keep the city clean.Xu Wenhua feels sorry for the lack of attention to his daughter's growth and lucky for his wife's support. But he is proud to be dedicated to his job and being chosen as a delegate to attend the 18th National Congress of Communist Party of China, scheduled later this year."I am just one of the very ordinary street sweepers, with no extraordinary achievement, good education or technical know-how. I just fulfill my responsibilities, and it's a great honor to be a CPC delegate," he said.
