Zhuang Shihua, director of the hospital affiliated with the Xinjiang Armed Police Corps in Urumqi, has been on the force for 39 years.Born into a poor family in the remote mountain village of Jianyang, Sichuan province, Zhuang completed his middle school education with the help of his hometown neighbors and then joined the army.Zhuang's medical expertise brought him many opportunities to make a fortune. One time, a businessman operating a private hospital asked Zhuang to head his hospital and offered him an annual salary of 1 million yuan ($154,000). But Zhuang turned down the offer and stayed in Xinjiang.Thanks to his influence, Zhuang's daughter also graduated from a medical school and came back to work in Xinjiang.Zhuang said he feels proud to be elected as a delegate of the upcoming 18th national congress of CPC."I will work harder to cooperate with the medical squad to assist poor regions and help make technology beneficial to more people of different ethnic groups," Zhuang said.
