Visitors from overseas media organizations on Wednesday toured a photo exhibition on China's achievements over the past decade.Six Japanese media organizations, including Kyodo News Agency and Asahi TV, and nine from Hong Kong and Macao visited the display at the Beijing Exhibition Center, the State Council Information Office said. The visiting media contingent comprised 33 journalists.Entitled "Scientific Development and Splendid Achievements", the exhibition explores China's development in various fields since the 16th CPC National Congress via photos, models, video clips and electronic albums.Models of China's spaceships, satellites and the space suit worn by Yang Liwei, the nation's first astronaut in space, caught the visitors attention as they entered the main hall.Qi Jige, a reporter from Macao Monthly, said: "I'm interested in China's achievements in science and technology and proud of them."He said that in the 13 years since Macao was returned to China, Macao residents have developed a stronger sense of belonging due to deeper exchanges between Macao and the Chinese mainland on economic and cultural issues.After visiting the Macao booth, Kou Dan-dan, a reporter from Macao Asia Satellite TV, said China's scientific and technological development has helped boost Macao's economic restructuring from gambling to services."It's amazing that I can buy authentic Macao food in Beijing," said Kou, talking about changes the Chinese mainland has experienced in the past decade.Joe Wu, a producer with Hong Kong-based i-Cable Television, was hugely impressed by China's economic achievements. He described improvements in people's living standards and housing as "marvelous"."Every time I come to Beijing, I can find changes," he said.Wu said that 10 years ago many Hong Kong residents were afraid of an economic slowdown. But with support from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has revitalized itself .President Hu Jintao and other senior leaders visited the exhibition when it opened on Oct 26. It runs through Nov 26.
