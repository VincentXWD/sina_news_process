An amendment to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was approved Wednesday, making the Scientific Outlook on Development as part of the Party's guide for action, according to a resolution of the 18th CPC National Congress.Unanimously agreed on by the delegates to the congress, the amendment juxtaposes the Scientific Outlook on Development along with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents.Hailing the Outlook as "the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the CPC and a long-term guiding ideology the Party must adhere to", the resolution said it represents the Party's latest achievement in adapting Marxism to China's conditions.The congress called on all Party members to study the Scientific Outlook on Development more thoroughly, apply it more consciously and with greater determination, steadily improve institutions and mechanisms for implementing it, and apply it throughout the course of China's modernization and to every aspect of Party building, said the resolution.
