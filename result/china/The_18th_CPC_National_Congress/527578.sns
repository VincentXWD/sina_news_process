Leadership transition draws global media attention

The leadership transition of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made headlines Friday in both domestic and overseas media, which included extensive analysis of the new faces in the Party's highest decision-making body as well as China's future development path.The People's Daily, an organ of the CPC Central Committee, carried an editorial Friday hailing the new central leadership headed by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee.It said that the new leaders elected to the Party's central authorities are young, and have both capability and integrity, noting that the election result fully reflects "the will of the Party, which is thriving and full of vitality, and the wishes of the people across the nation."According to the editorial, all Party members are convinced that the Central Committee of the CPC, with Xi Jinping as general secretary, will complete its daunting tasks by leading the nation to promote scientific development and social harmony, and it will improve people's livelihoods and welfare.It also paid tribute to Hu Jintao and other former leaders who have stepped down from leading posts, hailing their contribution to hard-earned historic achievements in the nation over the past decade.Meanwhile, the People's Liberation Army Daily said Friday that Xi's election as chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission (CMC) and recent personnel adjustments in the CMC will help reinforce the Party's absolute leadership over the military, pledging the loyalty of the army and armed police forces."We will resolutely take orders from the Party's central authority, the Central Military Commission and Chairman Xi," said the editorial.Xi's election as both head of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission was the first time in decades these positions were both given to the same person at the same time. Xi's predecessor Hu took over the CMC two years after becoming general secretary of the CPC Central Committee.The Pakistan Today newspaper hailed Hu's exit from the CMC as "graceful," while Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po quoted observers as saying that "it is of great significance for the institutionalization of the Party's leadership transition," noting that it could be as significant as the abolishment of the life tenure system for leaders, provided this progress can be extended in the future.The Guardian focused on the smaller Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, which saw its seats cut from nine to seven. It said this will make decision-making more "effective."Xinhua revealed Thursday that during a meeting in May, the CPC Central Committee held a democratic recommendation for candidates to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau.Reuters said the move suggests the Party is trying to increase accountability and subjecting its members to more checks and balances.The Macao Daily News turned its focus to the 15 newcomers in the 25-member Political Bureau, saying it shows the Party's growing talent pool and its bold use of new talents.Other reports paid great attention to Xi's speech and his debut as top Party leader.Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper said Xi used his speech to display a populist tone instead of listing socialist theories. It said Xi's speech, which touched upon better education, more stable jobs, and more income, sounded a little like a politician campaigning for office.AP said Xi "has an ease and affability," quoting former US ambassador to China Jon Huntsman as saying that "he's someone who you can connect with."The media has stressed that there are serious challenges confronting the new leadership, with China now facing a slowdown in economic growth and growing public discontent over corruption and social inequality. Many editorials noted that reforms on the political and economic fronts are sorely needed to solve the problems.Meanwhile, foreign media is paying close attention to China's foreign policy under the new leadership.The Asahi Shimbun said that as a lower house election will be held in Japan next month, after the new leaderships of both Japan and China get on track, they should try to improve bilateral relations."They should put an end to the current situation in which the two countries' top leaders cannot even talk to each other when they meet at international gatherings," it said.
