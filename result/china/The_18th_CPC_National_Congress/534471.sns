Xi calls for powerful missile force The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been ordered to build a powerful and technological missile force by Xi Jinping, the newly elected chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC).Xi, also newly elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made the comments on Wednesday while meeting delegates at the 8th Party congress of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s Second Artillery Force.The artillery force is the core strength of China's strategic deterrence, the strategic support for the country's status as a major power, and an important cornerstone safeguarding national security, Xi said.The Party and military leader stressed the absolute CPC leadership over the military, and called for promoting the PLA's glory, fine traditions and working styles, in order to ensure the army's "absolute loyalty, purity and reliability."The authority of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission should be consciously safeguarded, and the military should "keep pace with" the leadership in ideology, politics and actions, Xi said.The military "should absolutely follow the command of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission at any time and under any circumstances," he said.Xi also ordered the training of special personnel on joint operations, information-based management and missile technologies.The military should be ruled by law, he said, adding the phenomena of lawlessness, lax enforcement and not punishing law-breakers in a timely fashion, should be ruled out.The security and stability of the military should be ensured, he added. Xi reiterates China's peaceful development and opening-up policy Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Wednesday used his first meeting with foreign guests since his election to stress China's commitment to peaceful development and opening-up policy."China is following a path of peaceful development," Xi told a group of foreign experts working in China.He was sworn in as leader of the ruling party of the most populous country last month after the 18th CPC National Congress.Xi said that the country's progress is not a selfish kind that will prove detrimental to other countries.China's development will never be a challenge or a threat to any other country or the world at large, Xi said."China will never seek hegemony or expansionism," said Xi, who is also chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission.The more China develops, the more it is conducive to peace and development of the world, he added.Xi said China is not only an active advocator but also a real doer of win-win cooperation in the world, committed to pragmatic cooperation with all other countries and providing assistance to other developing countries as much as it can.As a developing country itself, China has offered aid to over 160 countries and more than 30 international and regional organizations, most of which goes to low-income developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania and Eastern Europe.The world has become an international community in which every one shares the same fate, and no country can prosper without others, Xi said, so all countries should make concerted efforts to address the current complex economic situation and other global issues.He called for a more equal and balanced global partnership to be established so as to safeguard the common interests of all human beings.During the meeting, Xi also reiterated China's "unswerving" policy of opening up, pledging that the country will continue to "open the door to the outside" for further development.Since adopting the reform and opening up policy more than three decades ago, China has steadily integrated itself into the global economy.It now has significant influence on world prosperity due to its status as the world's second-largest economy, biggest manufacturer and exporter and owner of the largest amount of foreign exchange reserves, and its fast pace of development."We are clear that China is still a developing country facing a series of grim challenges in spite of great progress that has been achieved," said the Chinese leader.The Chinese people feel neither inferior nor superior, ready to learn from the achievements of all other cultures, Xi told the experts."One loses by pride and gains by modesty," Xi said, quoting an ancient Chinese proverb.China cannot achieve success in development with its door closed, Xi said, "Our course is the one that is supported by people from all over the world.""To reach the goals that have been set, we need the understanding and support of the people from all over the world besides the fundamental factor of the Chinese people's hard work," said the Chinese leader.He expressed his gratitude and welcome for foreign experts of various specialties to participate in China's drive for modernization.OPEN TO ADVICEQuoting the famous Confucian line "If three of us are walking together, at least one of the other two is good enough to be my teacher," Xi said that he was open to suggestions of the experts.A total of 20 foreign scholars attended the gathering at the Great Hall of the People.During the meeting, Pedro Nueno, a Spanish expert in business admininstration, suggested China should encourage companies' innovation and promote the development of venture capital activities.Katharina Kohse-Hoinghaus, a German scholar in chemistry, thought China should improve academic environment to promote multidisciplinary partnerships and help young people be equipped with keen determination in the pursuit of truth as well as innovation.Some other scholars raised proposals in areas such as environmental protection and Chinese farm produce's engagement in the international market.Applauding the "inspiring" suggestions, Xi said he will carefully study them with his colleagues.The scholars, specializing in extensive areas including mathematics, manufacturing, laws and diplomacy, were from 16 countries, developed and developing.
