Every Chinese has a Chinese dream. In ancient times, the unyielding Chinese made the loud resolution: Anyone who invades into China will be punished inevitably, no matter how far the distance is! That was the Chinese dream of those days, when China was plagued with poverty and weakness.Time elapses, and China is growing to be a visible power. Today, the Chinese dream has been invested into more significant aspirations, as the new General Secretary of the Party Xi Jinping said in his debut speech, people now are dreaming---- the younger generation to lead a happy and healthy life; the family to be fairly well-off; the motherland to grow strong and prosperous.Then, what Chinese dream means to You ?Scholars interpret "Chinese dream" after Xi's speechScholars have joined millions of Chinese Internet users to interpret the "Chinese dream," a catchphrase that was recently used by the country's new helmsman, Xi Jinping, to describe the "great renewal" of the Chinese nation.During a visit to an exhibition in Beijing on Nov. 29, Xi, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said, "Realizing the great renewal of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream for the Chinese nation in modern history."Wu Jianmin, a veteran diplomat and former president of the China Foreign Affairs University, said the Chinese dream is highly significant because it represents the aspirations of 1.3 billion people.It is about the great cause of China's modernization and has a broad coverage of all social sectors, he said.It is also a dream that has been and will be shared by the world. Since the country launched its reform and opening up in 1978, many foreigners have found opportunities in China and realized their dreams, Wu added."The Chinese dream is about solving China's problems," according to Zheng Bijian, former executive vice president of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.The Chinese can neither afford to dream of consuming 25 barrels of oil per person each year like the Americans, nor they can pursue their dream of development by colonization, he said."Fundamentally, the Chinese dream is about using a peaceful, civilized way to realize national development and the modernization of a socialist country," in Zheng's view.If the Chinese dream needs to be fulfilled, the key lies in the ruling CPC, according to Liu Yunxian, a professor with the China Executive Leadership Academy-Pudong in Shanghai.To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the CPC ought to comprehensively strengthen its capacity in governance and maintain its advanced nature and purity, he said.Shortly after Xi's remarks, Internet users began to compare the "Chinese dream" with the "American dream," which is believed to mean equal opportunity for prosperity and success and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work for each individual.While acknowledging the many similarities of the two belief systems, Web users contend the "Chinese dream" is distinguished from the "American dream" because it also suggests collective aspirations to work for a stronger country and realize the rejuvenation of a nation.Netizens have also come up with their own versions of dreams that range from "less corruption," "a better life" to "a more polite society.""My version of the Chinese dream is national prosperity, social progress and people's happiness," famous Chinese scholar Yi Zhongtian wrote in his microblog account at Twitter-like service Sina Weibo."We need a Chinese dream, but also more practitioners to fulfil it," he added.Xi says economic growth must be tangible, not exaggeratedChina must maintain economic growth and persevere with market-oriented reforms in the face of multiple risks in the economy, the new helmsman of China's ruling party has said.The government should continue its proactive fiscal and prudent monetary policies next year and improve the economy's internal vigor and dynamic, said Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, at a symposium held with non-Party figures here last week."The growth that we achieve must be tangible, not exaggerated growth, and should be efficient, of good quality and sustainable," Xi said.He urged adherence to market-oriented reforms and well-conceived top-level reform designs."Targeted measures should be carried out in a timely way, while gradual progress in the overall reforms should be combined with breakthroughs in certain parts," said the leader. "We must explore boldly and pursue substantial results."Other priorities of tasks in 2013 include supporting agriculture, restructuring the economy and improving people's livelihoods, according to the general secretary.China has to prepare itself for multiple risks and challenges that can not be underestimated now or in the coming period, though the fundamentals of the economy are healthy, Xi stressed.The world economy will continue to grow at a slow rate, while domestic companies are troubled by cost rises and weak capabilities in innovation, and conflicts are increasing between inadequate demand and excessive production capacity as well as between economic development and the environment, Xi elaborated.China's economy expanded 7.4 percent year on year in the July-September period, slowing for the seventh consecutive quarter.However, official data has showed recovering fixed-asset investment, industrial activity and retail sales in recent months.China's economy is stabilizing and the government will maintain continuity and stability in its macro-economic policies next year, according to a statement released after a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Tuesday.
