I hope the friendship forged between Chinese and Japanese people through joint effort in disaster relief will be long lasting and solid," said Wen.Wen arrived in Japan Saturday for the 4th trilateral leadership meeting among China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK).Wen will visit Fukushima later Saturday afternoon, where the March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.Fukushima is still struggling to control nuclear radiation.Chinese foreign Ministry said earlier that the visit to Fukushima is a personal choice of Premier Wen, to show China's support for the nation's reconstruction efforts.Wen will hold a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Sunday morning. It will be the first formal meeting between the leaders of China and Japan since their tie worsened last year after Japan's coast guard arrested the captain of a Chinese fishing trawler whose boat had collided with Japanese patrol ships near the Diaoyu Islands in East China Sea.Observers said the visit is an important step in improving China-Japan relations.
