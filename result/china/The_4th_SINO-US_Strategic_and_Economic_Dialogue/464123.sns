BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao on Thursday called on China and the United States to break the traditional belief that big powers will enter into conflicts, and seek new ways to develop relations between major countries.Hu made the remarks when addressing the Opening Session of the fourth round of China-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogues (S&ED) on Thursday morning in Beijing."Whatever changes may take place in the world and no matter how the domestic situations in our two countries may evolve, China and the United States should be firmly committed to advancing the cooperative partnership and build a new type of relations between major countries that is reassuring to both peoples from China and the United States and people across the world," Hu said.To build such a new type of relations between China and the United States as two major countries, we need to think creatively, he said.Forty years ago, China and the United States made a creative move by issuing the Shanghai Communique, said Hu, adding that the Communique, which both affirmed the shared views of the two countries and listed their differences truthfully, established the basic principles guiding China-U.S. relations.Hu said that China and the United States are now in the second decade of the 21st century, and the both sides need to advance with the times in our thinking, policies and actions."We should, through creative thinking and concrete steps, prove that the traditional belief that big powers are bound to enter into confrontation and conflicts is wrong and seek new ways of developing relations between major countries in the era of economic globalization," he said.
