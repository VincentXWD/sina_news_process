BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A new round of China-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) on Thursday highlighted the will of both sides to build new relations in the era of economic globalization.China and the United States should break the traditional belief that big powers will conflict with each other, and seek new ways to develop relations between major countries, said Chinese President Hu Jintao when addressing the opening session of the fourth round of the S&ED in Beijing.To build such a new type of relations between China and the United States, Hu called on the two sides to advance with the times in their thinking, policies and actions.Over the past 30 years and more since its reform and opening-up process started, China has, through the hard work and wisdom of the Chinese people and win-win cooperation with people around the world, pursued peaceful development, he said."To follow the path of peaceful development is China's strategic choice that will never change, and it is a solemn commitment China has made to the world," according to Hu.To build a new type of relation between China and the United States, the president also called on the two sides to act in a spirit of equality and mutual understanding.Given different national conditions, it is impossible for China and the United States to see eye to eye on every issue, he admitted, calling on the two sides to expand common ground and properly manage their differences through dialogue and exchanges and by improving mutual understanding.As the world's top two economies were linked by shared global responsibilities, Hu suggested the two countries should step up coordination on regional and international issues, and promote peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.In a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, co-chairs of the dialogues, China Vice President Xi Jinping noted the significant consensus reached between the two state leaders already paved the way for China and the United States to explore and construct such a new relationship.Given the fact that China and the United States have so many differences in political system, history, culture and economic development, the two nations should bear the faith and determination that makes one a true hero to reach the Great Wall, as well as patience and wisdom to test each stone under step to cross a river, Xi said.He called on the two sides to continuously increase mutual understanding and trust, step up cooperation with mutual benefit, strengthen coordination on important regional and international issues, and promote friendship between the two peoples."This year is a pivotal year for the China-U.S. relationship," in the view of Xi, who expressed hope that the United States can eliminate disturbance, always bear the overall and long-term situation in mind and make joint efforts with the Chinese side to maintain the healthy and stable growth of the bilateral relations.Hillary Clinton said both sides had honest and deep exchanges at the current China-U.S. strategic and economic dialogue, and both sides should adhere to dialogue, expand cooperation, increase mutual trust and jointly cope with various challenges.The coexistence of interdependence and competition has become a prominent feature of China-U.S. ties, and a long list of global challenges could not be tackled without collaboration between the two nations, said Jia Xiudong, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies.Interaction between China and the United States has a great impact on the international situation, so it is necessary for the two sides to discuss establishing a new type of ties in the light of their national interests and the evolution of the world situation, said Jia.He added the S&ED has exerted an imperceptible influence on the habitual ways in which both sides cope with their differences.The inclination for dialogue and cooperation, which has been cultivated by the S&ED mechanism, is the fundamental factor for the building of a new type of relation between China and the United States, he stressed.The 3rd China-U.S. High-level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange was also held on Thursday.The fourth round of the S&ED started Thursday morning in Beijing.The dialogue was co-chaired by Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan and State Councilor Dai Bingguo, special representatives of Chinese President Hu Jintao, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, special representatives of U.S. President Barack Obama.The S&ED was created in 2009 to help both nations manage their bilateral relations and promote communication.
