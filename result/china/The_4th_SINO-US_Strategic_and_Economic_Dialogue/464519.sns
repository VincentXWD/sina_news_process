By Wang Qi, Sina English“China is not seeking after G2, but is willing to build C2, or the two in coordination with the US,” said Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, who is also special representative of President Hu Jintao co-chairing the unfolded fourth round of Sino-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED).China and the US will not seek to co-dominate the world or cultivate only the bilateral ties, albeit the increasingly visible importance, but we can be the two in coordination bent on more  communication, coordination and cooperation, Dai was quoted as saying on Wednesday, one day prior to the annual talks.His remarks coincide with the call of the Sino-U.S. S&ED for both sides to explore new model of peaceful coexistence , close cooperation and common development.Dai said under new circumstances, China and the United States should promote constructive interactions in Asian-Pacific region as both are of great influence over the region.Since the Asian-Pacific region spells out China's very existence and acts as the geographical base for its peaceful development. Hence, China would never be able to achieve peace and development without peace, stability and prosperity in the entire region, he added.Besides, the region has seen more intensive and frequent interactions between China and U.S. in recent days, making it a new horizon to reset China-U.S. relations.Mr. Dai also proposed four principles to follow for the bilateral interactions:To promote mutual respect and beef up mutual trust.To seek equality and mutual benefit in harmonious relations for common development.To keep open, inclusive and progressive in pushing for the development of regional cooperation mechanism.To seek common ground while preserving differences and share responsibilities, so as to promote common security by cooperation and properly handling regional flashpoints.
