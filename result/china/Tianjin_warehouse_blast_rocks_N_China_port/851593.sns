About 36 home owners who were evacuated after a serial of blasts hit a nearby warehouse storing chemicals in Tianjin port last month moved back to their former residence on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival.More than 1,100 died in the massive explosions at the busy port. The blasts also shattered windows in buildings at a neighborhood not far away, prompting the government to evacuate all of the residents there for safety reasons.
