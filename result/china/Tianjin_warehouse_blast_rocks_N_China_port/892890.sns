TIANJIN, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction of a train station severely damaged in the fatal warehouse blasts in north China's Tianjin City last year will start in March, authorities said on Wednesday.The Donghailu stop of a light-rail line linking downtown Tianjin and Binhai New Area, will be rebuilt at the original site, covering about 7,000 square meters, by February 2017, said a source with the construction and transportation bureau of Tianjin Binhai New Area.Explosions tore through a container warehouse storing large amounts of toxic chemicals at the Tianjin port on Aug. 12. The station was only about hundreds of meters from the blast site.The light-rail line suspended operations after the accident, but has been partially operational since Dec. 16.A park is expected to be built on the blast site.
