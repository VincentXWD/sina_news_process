Typhoon Muifa (international designation: 1109, JTWC designation: 11W, PAGASA Name: Kabayan) large typhoon currently threatening the Chinese coastline around the Yellow Sea. It is the ninth named storm, the fifth Severe Tropical Storm, the third Typhoon and the second Super Typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season.The low pressure area that became the typhoon originally formed on July 23. It gradually drifted to the west and became a tropical depression. It soon turned north and, on nearing the Philippines, rapidly strengthened and became a Category 5 Super Typhoon on the SSHS. There, the system claimed eight lives and caused a considerable amount of damage. The system felled trees with northeast Philippines experiencing strong winds and heavy rains leaving several roads and expressways jammed. The major typhoon also sank a Malay ship carrying 178 passengers. Then, the system then drifted straight north and weakened steadily until it curved to the west again, threatening Micronesia. The typhoon hit Okinawa, Japan, pouring 41 inches of rain flooding the small island injuring thirty seven people in thirty hours. The system disrupted the airways, leaving 13,630 people stranded on the island. The system then steadily drifted west, nearing Taiwan prompting emergency warnings and high alerts. However, the system simply passed by. The system moved further west, towards China, causing thousands to flee from their homes. A level 4 high wave warning system issued, and some 11,000 rescue workers in 120 teams mobilised.
