The newly-established East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone is in line with the interests of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, a mainland spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Speaking at a press conference, Fan Liqing, of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said, "Both sides of the Strait are of one family, and maintaining the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation is in line with the common welfare across the Strait, which is also a common responsibility for the two sides."The Chinese government issued a statement on Saturday announcing the zone had been established.Fan said the zone has been set up in accordance with international practices, and the United States and Japan established their own a long time ago."Normal flights of civil aircraft in the zone will not be affected," Fan said.Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has said that "the zone breaks the peaceful development across the Strait." In response, Fan said that the DPP made the remark because of the "Taiwan Independence" position. She added the zone does not affect any peaceful development.
