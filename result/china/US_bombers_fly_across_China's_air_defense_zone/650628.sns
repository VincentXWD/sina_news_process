China’s state media called Friday for “timely countermeasures without hesitation” if Japan violates the country’s newly declared air zone, after Beijing sent fighter jets to patrol the area following defiant military overflights by Tokyo.Japan and South Korea both said Thursday they had disregarded the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) that Beijing declared last weekend, showing a united front after US B-52 bombers also entered the area.China sent fighter jets and an early warning aircraft into the area Thursday, the official Xinhua news agency reported after Tokyo said its military and coastguard had both flown through it.Washington has security alliances with both Tokyo and Seoul, and analysts say that neither China nor Japan—the world’s second- and third-biggest economies, and major trading partners of each other—want to engage in armed conflict.The Global Times newspaper said in an editorial Friday: “We should carry out timely countermeasures without hesitation against Japan when it challenges China’s newly declared ADIZ. If Tokyo flies its aircraft over the zone, we will be bound to send our plane to its ADIZ.”The paper said: “If the trend continues, there will likely be frictions and confrontations and even tension in the air like in the Cold War era between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. We are willing to engage in a protracted confrontation with Japan.”But it shied away from threatening Washington, which sent giant Stratofortress bombers inside the zone, issuing an unmistakable message.“If the U.S. does not go too far, we will not target it in safeguarding our air defense zone,” the paper said, adding that Australia could be “ignored” and that South Korea “understands” as it has tensions of its own with Japan.(Agencies)
