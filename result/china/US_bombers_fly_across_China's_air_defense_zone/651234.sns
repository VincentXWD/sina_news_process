Biden on delicate mission to defuse tensions in East Asia

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will try to strike a delicate balance of calming military tensions with China while supporting ally Japan on a trip to Asia this week that is being overshadowed by a territorial dispute in the East China Sea.Aiming to counter criticism that the United States is neglecting Asia because it is distracted by domestic politics and the Middle East, the White House has long been planning a visit by Biden to Japan, China and South Korea.In Tokyo on Tuesday, Biden will likely assure Japan that a military alliance with the United States dating back to the 1950s remains valid.Yet he will also try to calm tensions between the United States and China over the same territorial dispute when he goes to Beijing later in the week."It's especially important ... that we continue to amplify our messages that we are and always will be there for our allies, and that there is a way for two major powers in the U.S. and China to build a different kind of relationship for the 21st century," a senior Obama administration official said.Although Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the uninhabited islands, it recognizes Tokyo's administrative control and says the U.S.-Japan security pact applies to them, in a stance that counters China's attempts to challenge U.S. military dominance in the region."I think (Biden) will probably publicly restate the commitment the U.S. has under the mutual defense treaty and that the islands are covered under article five of the treaty and that we recognize Japan's administrative control and oppose any efforts to undermine that," said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. "It's essential that he says that publicly."PERSONAL STYLEBiden often relies on his affability and talent for personal relations when he meets foreign leaders and he feels he has a bond with Xi who he has known since before the Chinese president took office."He has a way of saying to somebody, 'I understand the predicament you're in, and far be it from me to tell you what to do, but I'm going to offer some advice,'" said Julie Smith, who was Biden's deputy national security advisor until June."Because he's got this personal relationship with Xi, they take him very seriously," Smith said. "They view him as an honest broker."It is not clear whether Biden will ask for Chinese help in pressuring North Korea to release U.S. war veteran Merrill Newman, 85, who it arrested last month.The Biden visit goes some way to addressing concerns among U.S. allies in Asia that Washington is neglecting the region because of budget fights at home, Iran nuclear talks and the Syrian civil war.Obama canceled a trip to Southeast Asia in October because of the partial U.S. government shutdown, and a much vaunted "pivot to Asia," a strategic rebalancing of U.S. priorities toward the Pacific, has yet to show many results.Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, announced in November that Obama would travel to Asia in April to make up for the canceled visit."The fact that (Biden's) visit encompasses both America's allies and America's chief rival in the region is intended to show that the United States is the only power able to maintain the balance in the region, which is absolutely what the pivot was all about," said Eyal, of the Royal United Services Institute.(Agencies)
