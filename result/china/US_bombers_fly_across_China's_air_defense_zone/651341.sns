Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday he would discuss China’s expansion of its air defense zone with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in Tokyo to coordinate their stance after apparently contradictory responses.China declared last weekend of the zone, which covers islands in the East China Sea at the center of a dispute between Beijing and Tokyo, and demands that aircraft submit flight plans when traversing the area.Tokyo has stopped Japanese airlines from submitting flight plans to Beijing but Washington said Friday it generally expected U.S. carriers to “operate consistent with” notification policies issued by foreign countries.“We want to hold consultation with U.S. Vice President Biden who will visit Japan this week and deal with the matter by coordinating closely between Japan and the United States,” Abe said.Biden is due to arrive in Tokyo late Monday for a 34-hour visit as part of his East Asian tour which will also take him to China and South Korea.The U.S. State Department statement was widely taken in Japan to mean Washington had effectively advised U.S. airlines to comply with the Chinese demand.But Abe and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said Washington had not explicitly requested U.S. carriers to submit flight plans to Beijing.“We have confirmed it through diplomatic channels,” Abe told reporters, according to Jiji Press news agency.Onodera, speaking on public broadcaster NHK, said: “The U.S. government is taking the same stance with Japan” over the air defense zone.“The U.S. side has rather been quicker than Japan in responding to this issue. It has issued a strong message,” the defense chief said.The Pentagon has indicated that American military forces would continue normal operations, despite China scrambling fighter jets to monitor U.S. and Japanese aircraft in the zone.Jiji said Abe and Onodera were possibly trying to deny any damaging difference between the Pacific allies over the air zone issue.(Agencies)
