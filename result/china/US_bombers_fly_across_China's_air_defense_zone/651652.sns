U.S. Vice President Joe Biden urged Japan and China to lower tensions that have spiked since Beijing announced an air defense zone over disputed islands in the East China Sea, while repeating that Washington was "deeply concerned" by the move.The United States has made clear it would stand by treaty obligations that would require it to defend the disputed islands, but is also reluctant to get dragged into any military clash between the Asian rivals.Biden will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday before flying to China the next day as part of an Asian trip in which he will seek a delicate balance between calming tensions over the zone while backing key ally Japan."We remain deeply concerned by the announcement of a new Air Defense Identification Zone," Biden said in written answers to the Asahi daily newspaper."This latest incident underscores the need for agreement between China and Japan to establish crisis management and confidence building measures to lower tensions."(Agencies)
