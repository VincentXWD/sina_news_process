After China announced its air defense identification zone, South Korea will also confirm its new air defense zone expanding southward this week and notify neighboring countries of the plan before making a formal announcement, Seoul officials said Tuesday.In response to China's Air Defense Identification Zone (AIDZ), Seoul has been preparing a new air defense zone that includes an ocean research station built on an underwater reef and southern islands.According to Yonhap, South Korea's top security advisers will fine-tune the draft in a meeting slated for later this week and confirm the new air defense zone, without stating a specific date.The timing coincides with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's upcoming visit to South Korea during his weeklong trip to Northeast Asia later this week, which also includes stops in Japan and China."Once the plan is finalized, we will explain the meaning of the new air defense zone to the U.S., China and Japan," a senior government official said, asking for anonymity. "As a responsible member of the international community, the South Korean government will try to give enough explanation to neighboring nations so as not to undermine trust with them."During a senior defense meeting last week, Seoul asked Beijing to redraw the line, but was turned down by the Chinese side.
