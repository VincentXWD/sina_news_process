Fifty-five airlines in 19 countries and three regions have reported their flight plans to China over the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday."China has gained understanding from an increasing number of countries over the establishment of the zone. People have come to realize it is a safe and cooperative area, rather than risky and confrontational," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily news briefing.Hong's comment came after a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.Biden, who was in Tokyo for the start of a three-nation tour of Asia, told a news conference on Tuesday that concerns will be raised with leaders in China regarding the newly formed Air Defense Identification Zone in the interest of lowering tensions in the region."We are willing to keep in touch with relevant parties over technical issues and maintain flight safety and order on the basis of equality and mutual respect," Hong said.He reiterated that China's ADIZ is aimed at defending its national sovereignty, territorial and airspace security, as well as safeguarding flight safety, and is in accord with international laws and practices.The normal flight of international flights in the zone will not be affected, he said.Hong criticized Japan for unilaterally escalating regional tension, and urged it to respect China's legitimate rights, stop provocation and make efforts to improve bilateral ties and regional peace and stability.Other countries should hold an objective and fair view of China's ADIZ, and understand, respect and cooperate with China, Hong said.Biden arrived in Beijing Wednesday morning for a two-day visit and will then fly to the Republic of Korea.When asked to comment on the National Security Council launched by Japan on Wednesday, Hong said Japan should follow a path of peaceful development and promote regional peace and stability.Due to historical reasons, Asian neighbors and the international community have always watched closely Japan's military and security trends. A number of negative signals have emerged this year, Hong said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe denies the history of Japanese aggression, and his deputy is striving to amend its constitution, according to Hong, who said, "How can such remarks assure its Asian neighbors?"The spokesman urged Japan to prioritize the concerns of its neighbors, and follow a peaceful development path in line with the times.
