South Korea announced a southward expansion of its air defense zone yesterday to partially overlap a similar zone declared by China two weeks ago.Announcing the expansion of its own zone that would include the nation’s two southernmost islands of Marado and Hongdo as well as the Suyan Rock, South Korea’s defense ministry said the move would not infringe on neighboring countries’ sovereignty.The rock is a submerged reef within the overlapping exclusive economic zones of China and South Korea.The airspace above the rock is also covered by Chinese and Japanese air defense zones.“We believe this will not significantly impact our relationships with China and with Japan as we try to work for peace and cooperation in northeast Asia,” the defense ministry’s head of policy, Jang Hyuk, said at a news briefing.“We have explained our position to related countries and overall they are in agreement that this move complies with international regulations and is not an excessive measure,” he said, adding that the ministry’s top priority was to work with neighboring countries to prevent military confrontation.The defense ministry said its eastern and western boundaries remained the same as before.The new zone would take effect from December 15.South Korea’s air defense zone was originally established by the US air force in 1951 during the Korean War. The extension of the zone will not apply any restrictions to the operation of commercial flights, the defense ministry said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said last Friday that if South Korea were to expand its air defense zone, it must “accord with international law and norms,” but added: “China is willing to maintain communications with South Korea on the basis of equality and mutual respect.”Senior South Korean officials had been meeting last week to discuss plans to extend its air defense zone.
