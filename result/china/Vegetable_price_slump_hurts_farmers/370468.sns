Vegetable prices have tumbled across China for a third consecutive week. According to figures from the Agriculture Ministry, last week's average cost for 28 different items was down 8.8 percent, from the same period last year. How are farmers coping with this dip, and what's causing the current trend?Harvest time doesn't always make farmers smile.It can occasionally break their hearts instead.Vegetable Farmer of Shandong Province said, "It's so cheap. But there are still no buyers. I don't know what to do. What can I do? How can I live?"Sadness drowns this village, and perhaps all of Shandong Province, one of China's major vegetable growing regions.Local cabbage prices have dropped below 0.1 yuan per kilogram this year.Farmers say when the new sowing season began, they planted more cabbage than usual, in a bid to boost profits.Yu Changping, Shandong Begetable Farmer, said, "We follow market trends. Last year's price was good, so we grew more, in hopes of making more money when the cabbages went to the market this time."2.6 yuan per kilogram, last year's price, was handsome indeed.Seeds were sown earlier as well."We were thinking, if we grow early, then we can sell early, and sell more." Vegetable farmer of Shandong Province said.But oversupply problems have hit these farmers from out of blue.What once looked like fat profits, quickly became huge losses."My entire family live on these cabbages. The loss is so high, nearly 45-thousand yuan per hectare." Yu Changping told us.In March, the State Council requested local governments to collect and share vegetable supply and demand information with farmers.But did they really get the help they need?"No. Never. Nobody asked. Nobody said anything." Yu said.Yu says he has seeds for other vegetables in hand. But he doesn't know which product to grow.He just hopes the overabundant cabbage ordeal of 2011 ... never happens again.
