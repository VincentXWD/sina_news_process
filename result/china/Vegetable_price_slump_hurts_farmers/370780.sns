BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) initiated here on Wednesday an emergency activity for supermarkets to help with the sales of vegetables suffering price slumps following a large harvest in some regions.At the activity, 12 supermarkets in Beijing jointly advocated that supermarket chains should act to maintain the stability of the vegetable market and protect the interests of vegetable growers suffering from price slumps.Vegetables are being sold at surprisingly low prices in some regions, causing huge losses for farmers.According to data from the MOC, the average prices for 18 types of vegetables plunged 9.8 percent from April 11 to 17.The ministry said Tuesday in a statement that local authorities should take measures to help farmers sell their produce.
