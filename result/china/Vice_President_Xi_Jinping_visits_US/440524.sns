Â Xi joined dozens of ordinary Americans for tea at a local house owned by his old friend Sarah Lande here Wednesday.Most of the participants at the tea reception were Xi's old acquaintances back from his 1985 visit, when Xi, then a local official from China's northern province of Hebei, visited Iowa as a member of an agricultural exchange delegation, and stayed with a local family in Muscatine to better understand Iowan farm life.
