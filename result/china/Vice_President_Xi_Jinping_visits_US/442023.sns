ISTANBUL, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The second day of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's visit to Turkey was packed by political meetings on topics ranging from economic cooperation to regional situation.Xi met with Turkish Parliament Speaker Cemil Cicek and held talks with President Abdullah Gul in Ankara earlier Tuesday. After arriving in Istanbul Tuesday afternoon, he met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The Chinese vice president and Turkish leaders discussed ways and means to advance bilateral ties, particularly in economic and trade areas.Both sides agreed to advance China-Turkey strategic and cooperative ties, which were officially forged in 2010.During his talks with the Turkish president, Xi made a four-point proposal on furthering China-Turkey relations, including maintaining bilateral high-level exchanges, expanding economic and trade cooperation, stepping up people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, as well as enhancing cooperation on a multilateral basis.He said China supports its enterprises to increase imports from Turkey and will address the issue of trade imbalance in an "comprehensive way", adding that China welcomes Turkey to increase its investment in China as well.China is willing to work with Turkey to promote cooperation between their think tanks and non-governmental bodies, and expand tourism cooperation, said Xi."China supports Turkey to play an active role in international and regional affairs and is ready to enhance cooperation with Turkey in the UN, G20 (Group of 20) and IMF (International Monetary Fund)," Xi added.Speaking of the situation in Syria, Xi said China supports all diplomatic mediation efforts that are conducive to restoring stability in West Asia and North Africa.He also said China supports countries in the region to deal with their domestic affairs independently, adding the international community and regional countries should respect the UN Charter and basic norms of the international law and work actively and constructively to help ease tensions there.In his meeting with Erdogan, Xi said China attaches great importance to the issues of trade imbalance and will adopt measures to solve it."We should take advantage of the current favorable conditions and strive to finalize negotiations on one or two major projects which are both influential and have good economic returns," he said.He also suggested the two sides deepen bilateral financial cooperation."We should sign a pact on local currency settlement at an early date and realize local currency settlement in bilateral trade," he said.He suggested that the two sides enhance high-tech cooperation in such areas as nuclear energy and aerospace.Erdogan hoped the two countries would strengthen cooperation in energy, aviation, aerospace, high-speed rail system and tourism.To ensure the healthy and steady growth of bilateral ties, Xi said China hopes Turkey will continue to oppose and curb anti-China separatist activities by "East Turkistan" force in Turkey.Xi stressed that the "East Turkistan" issue concerns China's national security, social stability as well as its core interests.In response, Erdogan said Turkey would adhere to the one-China policy and tolerate no activities that undermine China's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Turkish territory.He also said the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of all Chinese people while Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory.When meeting Parliament Speaker Cicek, Xi said mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests is the cornerstone of bilateral strategic ties.China firmly supports Turkey to maintain domestic political stability and economic growth while Turkey also gives China precious support on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet, Xi said.Xi is visiting Turkey as President Gul's guest. Turkey is the last leg of his three-nation tour, which has already taken him to the United States and Ireland.
