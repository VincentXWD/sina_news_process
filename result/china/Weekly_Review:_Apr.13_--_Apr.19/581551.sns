Details remain sparse, but Quentin Tarantino’s “Django Unchained” is expected to be back in China’s theaters soon, after some further editing.One person who was briefed on plans for the film said late Friday that it would undergo additional cuts to qualify it for the Chinese film market, following some slight earlier changes to its presentation of bloodshed. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the plans because of confidentiality strictures.It remains unclear precisely when or how widely the film will eventually be seen in China.On Thursday the movie was abruptly pulled from Chinese theaters on its first day of release, with little explanation. Moviegoers were told only that there was a technical problem with the film.(Agencies)
