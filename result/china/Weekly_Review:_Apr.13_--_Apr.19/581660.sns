In a meeting held on Sunday in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry agreed on the need for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to take “concrete steps” toward denuclearization.Another issue on the agenda during Sunday’s meeting was the handling of China at a time when Tokyo and Beijing are locked in a dispute over “the ownership of the Diaoyu Islands” in the East China Sea.At the joint news conference, Kerry said the United States stands by the “principles” that govern the long-standing U.S. policy toward the disputed islands, saying that “Washington recognizes the islands are under Japanese administration”.“We oppose any unilateral or coercive action that would somehow aim at changing the status quo,” Kerry said, noting actions that could raise tensions or lead to miscalculations affect the peace and stability of the region.
