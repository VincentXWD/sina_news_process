Fernando Alonso took Ferrari's first victory of the season here on Sunday at the China Grand Prix, the third race of this year's Formula One world championship, having it comfortably sewn up with a big margin lead of 10.1 seconds ahead of a close battle for the second place between three other drivers.This is the second China Grand Prix victory for Alonso, who won here at Shanghai International Circuit, with a lap distance of 5.451km, in 2005. The only other twice winner in China GP is Briton Hamilton, who won it in 2008 and 2011.Alonso, starting from the third position of the grid, took the lead early in the race from Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who started from the pole, and slowly eased away from the pack, coming across the finishing line in one hour 36 minutes and 26.945 seconds.Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus lost places at the start to the two Ferraris in Sunday's race as Hamilton leads the pack away, but the Finn, winner of March's season opener in Australia, came home second, with just 2.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton, who also finished on podium.Defending world champion Sebastian Vettel was narrowly held off to the fourth place by just 0.2 second accross the line. The German driver, who claimed this year's second round victory for Red Bull two weeks ago in Malaysia's Sepang International Circuit, recorded the race's fastest lap with 1:36.808, but his Renauld RB9 just seemed lacking straight-line speed, even with the DRS.British driver Jenson Button of McLaren got a great start, but only managed the fifth ahead of Felipe Massa of Ferrari, while Daniel Ricciardo came out an impressive seventh.Mark Webber, starting from the pit lane, retired with a loose right rear wheel after having to pit by the end of his 15 laps, following a collision with Jean-Eric Vergne of Toro Rosso. Nico Rosberg's race was also aborted with a suspension issue after the German drove his Mercedes WO4 into the pit for four times in 22 laps.Force India's Adrian Sutil retired even earlier as the German stopped his run after five laps with a broken rear wing and brakes catching fire. And so did Sauber's Mexican driver Esteban Gutierrez.
