Manchester City succeeds to hang on against Chelsea and beat the defending champion 2-1 on Sunday to reach the 2013 FA Cup final.The 2011 Cup winner dominated the first hour as Samir Nasri's powerful shot and Sergio Aguero's header from either side of the game paved the way to a seemingly comfortable victory.But Demba Ba's acrobatic volley in the 66th minute made the game swung and inspired the holders to press for an equaliser.City's reserved keeper Costel Pantilimon showed his value in the final period with several stunning saves to reject Juan Mata's and Ba's close-range shots, ensuring his gritty side a return to Wembley on May 11 for the final against Wigan.The FA Cup is City's only realistic goal to claim a trophy this season after their rival Man United approached the Premier League title by leading the table with 15 points after the fixture also on Sunday.Chelsea, though failing to achieve the fifth FA Cup triumph in seven years, is so far the only English club left in European competitions by entering the semi-final in Europa League.
