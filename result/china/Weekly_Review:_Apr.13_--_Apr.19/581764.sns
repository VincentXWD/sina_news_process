He smiled graciously each time his competitor Daniel Day Lewis swept up the best actor awards at nearly the major ceremonies earlier this year.But Bradley Cooper was finally given his moment to shine as he picked up not one, but two, acting gongs at the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday night in Culver City, California.The 38-year-old, who plays a bipolar afflicted man in the David O. Russell hit, won Best Male Performance as well as Best Kiss with costar Jennifer Lawrence at the irreverent awards show.The actor, who accepted the award from an elegantly dressed Melissa McCarthy, kept his speech short and to the point, graciously thanking his Jennifer and the rest of the Silver Linings cast.He said the best part about playing the part was getting the chance to travel around the country meeting war veterans, who needBradley came onstage a second time after winning for Best Kiss with Jennifer in the romance flick.Jennifer wasn't at the ceremony, so the actor accepted the award solo, stating, 'Jenn's not here but she was great to kiss.'Emma Watson, meanwhile, scooped the award for Trailblazer for her work in movies such as Harry Potter and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.The actress was introduced by her My Week With Marilyn co-star Eddie Redmayne and Noah co-star Logan Lerman at the event at Sony Studios in Culver City, Los Angeles before Jonah Hill paid tribute to her via video.Eddie said: 'We all fell in love with her as Hermione Granger and since finishing Harry Potter she has dumbfounded us with her brave and fearless choices.'An emotional Emma, 22, admitted she was close to tears following the tributes and urged her fans to always follow their dreams.'I look back at the work I've done over the last 14 years and many things come to mind. Most importantly how bad my hair was in the first Harry Potter film.''You have supported me in all of my awkwardness and allowed me to grow into the kind of actress and kind of person I want to be,' she added.'I was the eager beaver in school, the first to put her hand up which is often not cool and I was teased mercilessly but I have learned if you put your heart into something amazing things will happen.'I promise to keep making the best work I can for all of you.'Samuel L. Jackson also claimed two awards, for Best WTF Moment with Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained as well as Best Fight prize along with other castmembers for The Avengers.Samuel and Jamie were presented the award by funnymen Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, whose monologue was mostly bleeped out due to expletives.The pair discuss the WTF moments they've experienced in the past. but most of what they say is bleeped out due to their use of expletives.'I don't remember the name of the horse, but the guy's name was [BLEEP] Gosling,' said Adam at one point.Jamie Foxx was a double winner, too, and later thanked his daughter, parents and siblings in the audience as he accepted the Generation Award for his career in film.Will Ferrell wore a three-piece suit covered in dollar bills to accept the Comedic Genius Award from Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage.'For those of you sitting here tonight who don't think I'm funny, I'll be happy to fight you in the parking lot after the show,' said Will, who is currently at work on Anchorman 2, slated for release later this year.'Here's the deal. I'm just a simple guy from Burbank, California. I had two basic dreams.'First to one day hopefully be able to make people laugh.The other dream to wake up every day and be able to dress myself exactly like Dennis Rodman,' he said.But then actress Aubrey Plaza ran onstage with #TheToDoList written across her chest, and tried to grab his award.Will looked confused but gave her a shout out and said 'just like we rehearsed it.'Tom Hiddleston picked up the Best Villain award for his role as Loki in Thor and paid tribute to One Direction singer Liam Payne's dog, who shares his name with the evil Marvel comic character.He said: 'I would like to thank Liam Payne from One Direction, who I believe has named his dog Loki. Liam's dog is certainly better looking, better bred and most certainly more well known with more Twitter followers than me and even though they don't know who Liam's dog is in Asgard, it's all about getting the word out.'Rebel, meanwhile, picked up the award for Best Breakthrough Performance.'I only do this for the awards. That and cash money,' said the actress as she accepted her award.'The only thing that would make this better is if Zac Efron took off his shirt right now and came and kissed me,' she said.Zac, who presented her with the award, kissed her, but kept his shirt on.'Do you want to give me an Australian kiss now? It's like a French kiss but down under.'Sure,' said Zac, who appeared to have missed the innuendo.Rebel drew big laughs from the crowd as she was shown performing in the top films of the year, in scenes that were supposedly cut.In one clip she was seen playing the 'Head Whore' in Les Miserables, singing in the background of Anne Hathaway's Oscar-winning song.'When I researched my role, I discovered a lot of 19th century prostitutes suffered from "Itchy Tit,"' she explains to Tom Hooper.Taylor Lautner scooped the award for Best Shirtless Performance, and he came onstage with a pillow strapped to his belly under his shirt.'I'll be honest with you. I turned 21 recently. And I've been eating and drinking.'He pointed to the topless shot behind him. 'That picture was taken a few years ago. The good old days. You could bounce a quarter off those things.'For us shirtless actors out there. This is like winning an Oscar.'Seth Rogen, Zac and Danny McBride presented Taylor with the award, and they performed a somewhat riqsue skit.Zac said he was disappointed that he didn't get nominated for Best Shirtless Performance, to which Seth said that he would have won Best Bottomless.Danny then challenged him to reveal his assets, and Seth happily obliged, dropping his trousers to reveal fake hair on his lower front.'It looks like LMFAO bending over to tie their shoes,' said Danny.Danny then dropped his trousers to reveal a chastity jockey strap.Seth holds up the key and starts sticking it in Danny's groin.'I'm not touching that,'  said Zac squeamishly.Star Trek's Zoe Saldana, Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine were on hand to announce Marvel's Avengers Assemble as winner of Best Fight which Tom Hiddleston, Joss Whedon, Chris Evans and Samuel accepted.Samuel said: 'Thanks to all the fans but we all need to thank our fearless leader Joss Whedon,' while Tom added: 'I'm happy to be hulk smashed any day of the week.'Other musical acts were Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Selena Gomez, who looked gorgeous in a red Indian-inspired chiffon dress as she performed her new song Here Come And Get It.She engages in a half yoga, half dance performance as she sports a bejeweled tilaka on her forehead.Her performance is reminiscent of Bollywood as she chants the lyrics: 'When you're ready, come and get it.'The Avengers won for Movie Of The Year, presented by Brad Pitt, who looked cool and casual with his blonde hair tied back in a ponytail.'What's the opposite of humbled?' asked writer Joss Whedon while accepting the award. 'We're Biebered to be standing here tonight.''I want to thank them for going off their meds long enough to be here tonight,' he said of the fans behind the stage.He then thanked his producer for juggling producing The Avengers with going through puberty.'From the first story board to the last sound tweak these people were amazing,' said Josh.He ended by announcing a sequel will come in 2015.The show also included unseen footage from next month's Iron Man 3 and the world premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire trailer.Hollywood has increasingly used the fan-driven MTV Movie Awards as a platform to promote its summer product. This year, the show was moved up from June to April to incorporate the entire blockbuster season, which begins in early May.Honorees and presenters represent upcoming movies, and the ceremony is typically peppered with commercials for forthcoming films and DVD releases.Movie of the Year The AvengersBest Female Performance Jennifer Lawrence, Silver Linings PlaybookBest Male Performance Bradley Cooper, Silver Linings PlaybookBreakthrough Performance Rebel Wilson, Pitch PerfectBest Scared-As-S–t Performance Suraj Sharma, Life of PiBest On-Screen Duo Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane, TedBest Shirtless Performance Taylor Lautner, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2Comic GeniusWill Ferrell for his work in movies such as Anchorman and ElfQuirky award: Jamie Foxx and Samuel L.
