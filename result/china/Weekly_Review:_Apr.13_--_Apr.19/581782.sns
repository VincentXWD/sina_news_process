One of the best things about going to Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is the cool pool parties that VIPs often get invited to.And it was clear to see that Katherine McPhee was enjoying the perks of being a celebrity as she attended a daytime gathering sponsored by fashion brand Guess.The 29-year-old Smash actress – who gained fame after competing on the fifth season of American Idol – was beaming as she soaked up the sun in a black bikini on Saturday.Katherine was spotted lounging back on a large white duck inflatable which comfortably fit two bodies at the hotel Viceroy’s pool in Palm Springs.Donning large dark sunglasses over her eyes and various paper wristbands among her own bangles, the star couldn’t help but grin and laugh as she was treated to drinks and cool star companions.Fashionable actress Chloe Sevigny worked the double denim look as she posed with a black and white paper fan plus an ensemble featuring floral print skirt and sleeveless shirt.Model Gigi Hadid – daughter of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster – had the same idea, posing in a denim bralet and miniskirt with white trainers.Ashley Benson and her Pretty Little Liars co-star Troian Bellisario seemingly poked fun at Ashley’s part in new film Spring Breakers.The screen stars pointed plastic water guns at the camera and each other’s heads.Other activities on offer included table tennis which actresses Christa B. Allen and Jessica Lowndes took part in.Jessica, 24, was seen hamming it up with her British rugby player boyfriend, Thom Evans, who previously dated English glamour model Kelly Brook.Polished pair Geordon Nicol and Leigh Lezark of the Misshapes attended party in co-ordinated gear of black white and denim to spin some music for the cool crowd.Glee star Chord Overstreet was also around looking eager to start a game of pool volley ball.Last year he was with girlfriend Emma Roberts, but they split up in May 2012.The three-day extravaganza is currently in it's first phase of two weekends featuring live music.The Stone Roses, Blur and Red Hot Chilli Peppers are among acts headlining at the popular annual event which closes Sunday April 21.Year after year many celebrities flock to the gathering in the desert climate of Indio, California and often frequent the pre-parties and after-parties thrown by sponsoring brands.Tickets to the first weekend sold out within 15 minutes of them going on sale.(Agencies)
