Japan scrambled fighter jets in response to Chinese aircraft a record number of times in the year to March 2013, mostly after the "nationalisation" of disputed islands, the Japanese government said Wednesday.Jets were sent airborne 306 times over the 12 months, double the previous year and more than the number of times they reacted to Russian planes—247—for the first time on record, the Defense Ministry said in a press release.In September last year, the Japanese government bought three of the five Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea.More than three-quarters of the mobilisations against Chinese aircraft, a total of 237, were in the October to March period.On December 13, a Y-12 turbo-prop plane from China’s State Oceanic Administration entered airspace over the Diaoyu islands, prompting the launch of Japanese F-15s.State-owned Chinese ships have patroled the islands dozens of times since September.(Agencies)
