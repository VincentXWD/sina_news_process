China revamps anti-money laundering rules

Chinese banks must rate their clients' risk of criminal conduct on a scale of 1-5 as part of the central bank's moves to curb money laundering and fraudulent transactions estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars a year.The new rules come as some experts cite China as the world's biggest source of 'dirty' funds and as it faces growing foreign pressure.Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based financial watchdog, estimated in December that China accounted for almost half of the $858.8 billion of illicit funds flowing into tax havens and western banks in 2010 - more than eight times the amounts for runners-up Malaysia and Mexico.Over an 11-year period from 2000, China was home to $3.8 trillion worth of illicit financial flows originating from corruption, crime or tax evasion, the watchdog said. The numbers cannot be verified as there are few estimates in the market.The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, issued its new anti-money laundering rules to financial institutions in December, requiring them to rate clients' risks based on their location and the nature of their businesses, including their levels of transparency, five accountants and bankers with knowledge of the rules said.The rules were not publicly announced, and banks and insurance firms have to implement them by December 2015, the accountants and bankers said.A person at the central bank, which oversees China's fight against money laundering, said the changes are intended to finesse regulations and improve monitoring efficiency. "One of the main goals is to change the method of regulation. Initial regulations were very cumbersome," he said, declining to be named.Financial institutions must now identify their riskiest clients and exercise discretion when reporting suspect deals. In the past, clients were rated against a checklist of money laundering traits without differentiating risk levels. That led financial institutions to inundate authorities with information and false leads that impeded checks, experts said.Agencies
