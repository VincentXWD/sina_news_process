A gem-encrusted gold Fabergé egg worth more than $1.5million has been unearthed by French traffic police in a routine car search near the Swiss border.Police pulled over the BMW saloon at a document check roadblock because it looked 'shabby and suspicious.'Inside the astonished officers found the solid gold egg set with diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds wrapped in an old cloth.Two Belarus nationals - and a third arrested later - are being held by police.‘One says they found it on the ground, another that they bought it cheaply at a flea market. They're not talking much,’ a French police official told local media.Police eventually identified the egg - which is made of more than a kilogramme of pure gold - as one stolen from a Kuwaiti import business in Geneva four years ago.‘We have the impression that we're dealing with a team tasked with transporting and negotiating the sale of the artwork,’ said one investigator.Three men aged between 24 and 38 have been charged with handling stolen goods and possessing a weapon.(Agencies)
