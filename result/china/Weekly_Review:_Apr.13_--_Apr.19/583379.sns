Being objective, I got every last drop out in London," said Hoy.He noted that the decision was made "literally down to whether I can do it or not" and did not want to "just make up numbers" at the Commonwealth Games next year.Hoy will act as an ambassador for the Commonwealth Games, where the track cycling will take place at a velodrome named after him.Commenting on Hoy's retirement, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said "Sir Chris Hoy is Scotland's greatest ever Olympian and one of the best sportsmen these islands have ever seen.""He is a true sporting legend of whom the whole of Scotland is justifiably proud and whose achievements are unparalleled. As well as his six Olympic gold medals and numerous other championships, the impact he has had on the sport of cycling is immense," Salmond was quoted as saying in a statement.
