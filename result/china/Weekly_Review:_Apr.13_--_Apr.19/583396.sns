'A touch of Sin' gets first Chinese entrant of Cannes

Jia Zhangke's "A Touch of Sin" is the first Chinese entrant for Palme d’Or in three years, while Hong Kong's Flora Lau premieres debut in Un Certain Regard.“I’m back!” So reads Jia Zhangke’s Thursday afternoon tweet, a few minutes after Cannes Film Festival artistic director Thierry Fremaux unveiled the mainland Chinese director’s latest offering, A Touch of Sin, as a Competition entry on the Croisette this year.Jia’s short message might be to mark his return to Cannes after a three-year lull – he was there the last time, competing in the Un Certain Regard sidebar, in 2010 with the documentary I Wish I Knew – but the tweet could also serve as his own clarion call for Chinese-language cinema, which will be represented on the Riviera next month by three entries in three different sections of the festival.(Agencies)
