By Xiong YuqingA postgraduate from Nanjing University has become famous online for her insistence on wearing vintage dress for the whole year recently."Some people might think I am wierd, but I am not doing anything wrong. I don't care whether people are judging me," said Dai Ying, who recognised herself as a traditional Chinese lady.When talking about Dai Ying, many students from Nanjing University describe her as a girl living in the last century. Some even call her 'the cheongsam sister', as she wears cheongsam and vintage style dress for the whole year.Actually, most of the vintage dresses Dai wears are made by herself. "She is knowledgable on fashion styles and is really good at needlework," said Dai's roommate.Besides needlework, Dai produces every dress from designing to the last step of embroidering. She also makes some accessories like brooches and earrings to match her clothes, and sometimes even old style umbrella."I feel great satisfaction when I finish a dress originally made by myself," Dai Ying said in an interview proudly.
