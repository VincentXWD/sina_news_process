The adventures of one fearless house cat
2013-04-19 08:40:43 GMT
This tabby cat looks a long way from home. Cuddling up to lions, stalking zebras and tormenting a elephant by pouncing at its tail, it's rather different from attacking mice in the back garden.Every cat owner knows its pet will do whatever it wishes, so it may be unsurprising to see a house cat fearlessly roaming around a game reserve and daring to get close to big predators.But if you thought the friendly feline was in danger from the bigger cats, think again. The playful pictures are the work of photographer George Logan and digital retoucher Tony Swinney for a Whiskas advertising campaign.(Agencies)
