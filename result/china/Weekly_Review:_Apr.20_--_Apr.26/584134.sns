The restoration of Seoul's 610-year- old Sungnyemun Gate, which was destroyed by fire five years ago, will be completed on April 30, local media reported Sunday.South Korea's top national treasure, the Sungnyemun Gate was the southern gate of the walls that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Construction of the gate began in 1395 and completed in 1398 during the reign of King Taejo, who founded the Joseon Dynasty.It is the oldest wooden structure in Seoul and was named the country's No.1 National Treasure in 1962. However, it was deliberately burned down in an arson attack in February 2008.The South Korean government started restoring the Sungnyemun Gate two years ago. The rebuilding project was scheduled to be completed by December 2012, but was delayed due to bad weather.It is reported that the government will hold a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the gate's restoration on May 4.
