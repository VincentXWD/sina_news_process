Red Bull's Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel took a commanding victory in the Bahrain Grand Prix for the second year in a row on Sunday to extend his overall lead to 10 points after four races.In a race with plenty of skirmishes on the track, but untroubled by anti-government protests and reported clashes elsewhere in the tiny Gulf kingdom, the German beat Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen by 9.1 seconds.The win, with Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa watching amid heavy security surrounding the Sakhir desert circuit, was Vettel's second of the season and 28th of his career.If the event itself was controversial to some, because of human rights concerns after the crushing of a 2011 uprising, the sporting outcome was a straightforward demonstration of supremacy."It was pretty dominant today," said the 25-year-old triple world champion, who started on the front row and was so far ahead after 25 of the 57 laps that he could pit and still come out in the lead, after swigging the winner's rosewater on the podium."Certainly we had more pace than we expected," he added after what team boss Christian Horner called "an absolutely impeccable drive".France's Romain Grosjean finished third for Lotus, his first podium since Hungary last July, to complete the same top three as last year.Britain's Paul Di Resta equalled his career-best finish, after leading for three laps, with fourth place for Force India after losing third to Grosjean with six laps to go as the Frenchman made the most of fresher tyres.Vettel now has 77 points to 67 for 2007 champion Raikkonen, who chalked up his 21st successive scoring finish and is three races away from equalling the record set by the now-retired Michael Schumacher.(Agencies)
