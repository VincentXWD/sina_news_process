Li Jingwei died of illness at the age of 74 on Monday in Sanshui county, South China's Guangdong Province, news portal sina.com.cn reported, citing confirmation from a local hospital.Li, who ran the beverage brand Jianlibao - known as "China's magic water" - in the 1980s, died in humble circumstances, with 13 years of his prison term still remaining.Li had made the State-owned Jianlibao in Sanshui county a nationally famous brand, but his desire to list the firm in Hong Kong amid a boom in business in the late 1990s was ruined by his fractious relationship with the Sanshui government. He also failed to push through a management buyout plan in 1999.Li was sued by prosecutors for misappropriation in 2002 and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in November 2011. Jianlibao, acquired by Taiwan-based Uni-President Group in 2005, has gradually lost its fame.Li was not the first of China's business tycoons to be sent to prison, and he won't be the last.Â
