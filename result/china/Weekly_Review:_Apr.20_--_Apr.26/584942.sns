Clinical Bayern Munich inflicted Barcelona the highest loss in 16  years as the Bavarians swept the Catalans 4-0 thanks to the brace by  Thomas Mueller at the first leg of Champions League semifinals on  Tuesday.The newly crowned German champions make a giant stride towards the  final in Wembley as they crushed Barcelona 4-0 at outsold Allianz Arena  due to the goals by Thomas Mueller, Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben. It  could be Bayern's third Champions League final in four years.The hosts ensured the first chance of the game when Javi Martinez set  up with his back heel for Arjen Robben, whose low shot on the target  was blocked by Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes.Barcelona tried to implement their infamous short passing game yet  they were unable to overcome Bayern's well-positioned defence.Nonetheless it was the hosts who broke the deadlock 25 minutes into  the encounter, as Mueller made use of Dante's header following a cross  to nod home from very close range at the near post.Four minutes later Barcelona nearly restored parity but Dante  defected the ball before onrushing Lionel Messi had the chance to tap in  at the center of the box.With the beginning of the second half the visitors quickened the  tempo but Bayern continued unfazed to double the lead at the 49th minute  when Mario Gomez capitalized on Mueller's header into the center to  slot home following a corner.Barcelona's Marc Barata had the chance to slot home unmarked inside the box but he pulled wide.Dutchmen Arjen Robben made it three when he danced through the  visitors defence to beat Valdes with a curl into the far corner at the  73rd minute.The Spanish giants were unable to free themselves from their own  territory thus Mueller exploited David Alabas low cross into the box to  tap in with eight minutes remaining.Barcelona will host Bayern Munich next Wednesday for the second leg of Champions League semifinals."It's great to win 4-0 against the best soccer team in the world," said Bayern CEO Karl Heinz Rummenigge.
