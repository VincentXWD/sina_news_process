A Chinese student, reportly as a son of a government official, was jailed yesterday for trying to bribe a British university professor with £5,000 to pass his degree.Yang Li also took an imitation firearm into the meeting with the don and another senior academic at Bath University.A court heard that Li, 26, was studying a masters degree in innovation and technology management and feared failure.He was dismayed to learn he had been given just 37 per cent for his dissertation which was a fail - and would have meant him spending an extra year at the university.That would have affected Li’s visa which he was hoping to upgrade from a student visa to a tier 1 visa.Li, who was born and educated in China, asked to meet Professor Andrew Graves and Dr Stephen Shepherd to discuss his options.Bristol Crown Court heard he told the pair ‘I am a businessman’ before placing £5,000 in cash on the table.He then said: 'There is a fourth option, you can keep the money if you give me a pass mark and I won’t bother you again.'When that failed and he was asked to leave he picked up his coat and a 0.177 air pistol fell from the pocket.Defending Li, Blake James said Mr Li came from an affluent family in China, where his father is a respected government official and businessman.Mr James said Li was not a 'sham student' and had come to the UK in 2006 for a Computer Science degree at the University of Bath, which he passed.He claimed Li had withdrawn the money that morning ‘for the weekend’ and had not meant to use it as a bribe.He added that the gun was in his pocket as he thought it was safer than the car, and he had no intention of using the weapon which he used for target practice.Mr Blake-James said: 'Mr Li is someone who is used to carrying large amounts of cash with him.'He was not thinking straight, he made an impulsive decision to use the money he had on him, which was a ridiculous gesture and ill-thought through.'He added: 'One of Mr Li’s pleasures is shooting in the garden of his house, and he intended to return to it after the meeting.'He had the gun in the pocket of his coat as he didn’t want to leave it in the car, he felt it was safer with him.'It was in no way connected to his meeting.'In his haste to leave the meeting, he picked up his coat and the gun fell to the floor.'Mr Blake-James said Li was of good character and from an affluent and successful family, with his father a Chinese government official and businessman.His parents, wife, who is also studying at the university, and parents in law were in court to support him.Documents show Li was progressing well in his masters course until he failed the dissertation, he said.At the time of the final module, Li was working for his father’s firm, earning £25,000 a year with a bonus of £11,000, as well as studying.Prosecuting, Mark Hollier said: 'The final part of the course is for students to submit a dissertation of about 12,000 words. That had to be in by the first week of September. Mr Li’s dissertation was submitted that September last year.'It was marked by Professor Graves. The pass mark is 40 per cent and the mark awarded was 37 per cent.'Li’s dissertation mark was checked by external examiners from Oxford and Cambridge University and found to be correct, Mr Hollier added.Li, 26, of Wellsway, Bath, admitted bribery and possession of an imitation firearm.He was sentenced to 12 months in prison for bribery and six months on the firearms charge, to run concurrently.(Agencies)
