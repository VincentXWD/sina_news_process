Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowskis scored all four goals against Real Madrid on Wednesday to ensure an advantageous position for the second leg of the Champions League semifinal in Bernabeu.Lewandowski donated four goals at outsold Signal Iduna Park to become the first player to have scored four goals in a Champions League semifinal match.Real Madrid were only able to restore parity before the break through Christiano Ronaldo but Lewandowski forked out three goals within 17 minutes to flabbergast the visitors.From the kickoff the hosts took the reins to press Madrid into their own territory. With seven minutes into the game Dortmund's Marco Reus dangerously approached Real's box to force keeper Diego Lopez to turn the shot around the far post.Without further warning Dortmund broke the deadlock with their second chance as Polish international Lewandowski slotted home a cross by Mario Goetze at the far post at the eighth minute.The visitors were unable to threat Dortmund's defence although goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller had to block a free kick by Ronaldo.Nonetheless, Real Madrid shocked the hosts as Gonzalo Higuain capitalized on an error by Dortmund defender Mats Hummels to set up with a square pass for Ronaldo, who scored the open goal two minutes before the break.Juergen Klopp men remained unimpressed as they grabbed the lead again when Lewandowski made use of Reus assistance to beat Diego Lopez into the near corner from close range, five minutes into the second half.The Germans were not done with the scoring as Lewandowski wrapped up his hat-trick at the 55th minute when he controlled the ball inside box to beat Pepe and Raphael Varane and hammered the ball into the top right corner.Things changed from bad to worse when Real's Xabi Alonso was penalized for a foul play on Reus inside the box to invite Lewandowski, who made it 4-1 on the scoreboards when he slammed the penalty into the center of the goal at the 66th minute.Real Madrid host Borussia Dortmund Santiago Bernabeu Stadium next week for the second leg of the semifinal."My team staged a brilliant performance today. However, the second leg wont be a walk in the park," Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp said after the victory.
