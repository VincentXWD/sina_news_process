Two people have been charged over pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge taken on holiday last year.Kate was pictured sunbathing topless with husband Prince William on holiday at a private villa in Provence, France.French sources say the two people charged are a photographer and the head of the publishers of French Closer magazine.The magazine was the first to publish the images last September but they also later appeared in Italy, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark.Ernesto Mauri, the chief executive of publishers Mondadori, was charged with "invasion of privacy" for having let the shots be published.The paparazzi photographer who took the topless photos has yet to be identified despite a criminal probe launched in October.However, photographer Valerie Suau has been charged with invasion of privacy for photos of Kate in a swimsuit which appeared in a newspaper.Closer, owned by a firm linked to former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi, was made to hand the topless images over by a Paris civil court.But they remained on the open market and also appeared in magazines across the globe.They have not been published by any UK media, but seven million Brits have seen the topless pictures, a survey has found, mainly through internet searches.Two-thirds of the 1,600 people polled by YouGov believed the photographer who took the controversial snaps should be prosecuted.Kate and Wills thought they would not be photographed as they stayed at the magnificent Chateau Dâ€™Autet, owned by a nephew of the Queen.French Closer was launched in 2005 as a version of the British mag owned by UK publishing company Emap.But it sold it on in 2006 to Mondadori France, a subsidiary of an Italian company.(Agencies)
