These rare photographs taken more than 150 years ago are thought to be among the first ever pictures taken of China.Showing Beijing in the days before sky-scrapers when it was still known as Peking, the photographs were taken by Anglo-Italian photographer Felice Beato and include the first ever panorama of the city.The collection also includes the only known photograph of the old Imperial Summer Palace before it was destroyed in 1860.(Agencies)
