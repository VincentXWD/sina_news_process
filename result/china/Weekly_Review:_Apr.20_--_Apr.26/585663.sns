CHINESE President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Francois Hollande pledged to push for a world free of domination by any superpower as the French leader arrived in Beijing on a mission to boost trade amid his country's worsening economic woes.Both leaders stressed their desire for a "multipolar" world yesterday that would dilute Washington's influence - though they did not mention the US in their comments."China and France are both great countries with a strong sense of independence," Xi said at a news conference, adding that the two countries would "actively promote a multipolar world and the democratization of international relations."Xi and Hollande, who is traveling with a delegation representing scores of French businesses, spoke to reporters after meeting at Beijing's Great Hall of the People yesterday."China and France both want a multipolar world. We want there to be a balance. We refuse a world of powers, and of superpowers," Hollande said."When China and France agree on a position, we can drive the world."Hollande is the first leader of a major Western country to visit China since President Xi took his post last month.French businesses hit by domestic declines are hoping for deals in China in areas including car making, nuclear energy and food exports. Hopes are high that French nuclear giant Areva and the Chinese energy group CNNC will sign letters of intent on the construction of a nuclear waste treatment facility.Carmaker Renault hopes to progress negotiations on a proposed factory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that would produce 150,000 vehicles per year.France is also pushing for greater access to the Chinese market for its charcuterie, or cooked pork meat, producers said.France registered a US$34 billion trade deficit with China last year and accounts for less than 2 percent of its foreign trade."There is an imbalance in our foreign trade and we hope to correct that," Hollande said. "Not by reducing our investment and exports, but by increasing them further, and we will be discussing this throughout our meetings and this trip."The French delegation will visit Shanghai today.Â
