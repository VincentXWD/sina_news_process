After more than three weeks, Django Unchained may soon be freed for release on Chinese mainland, with claiming a May 7 release has been set for a version with full-frontal nudity removed.Sony says it has not been notified of any release date.Since the film was abruptly pulled from the country’s screens on the morning of April 11 – with some cinemas actually having to stop already-underway screenings after receiving directives from official distributors China Film Group – speculation has abounded about when Quentin Tarantino’s film will be green-lit again for release, if at all.Quoting an individual with knowledge of the situation, sina.com reports that the film's nudity has been removed and that the new version will be released in early May.Meanwhile, a post on the TNABO microblog said Django Unchained will be “returning to the big screens on May 7” after undergoing another round of censorship, with its specific reference to “big screens” pointing to how the cancellation of the original release has led to film buffs reporting of having watched the film on illegal downloads or pirated discs.(Agencies)
