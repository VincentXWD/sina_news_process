China urged the United States on Thursday, 10 days after the Boston Marathon bombings, to condemn the terrorist attacks in northwest Chinaâ€™s Xinjiang instead of lecturing the country on human rights.Nine residents, six police and six ethnic Uighurs were killed on Tuesday in a knife, axe and arson attack.Chinese authorities called the violence terrorism and Xinjiang spokeswoman Hou Hanmin was quoted on Thursday by the Global Times as comparing it to the recent Boston Marathon bombings.But the U.S. State Department on Wednesday merely expressed regret at the loss of life and urged China to "provide all Chinese citizens, including Uighurs, the due process protections to which they're entitled".The U.S. refusal to condemn the attack showed double standards, considering that it had been the recent victim of a terrorist attack, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters."We simply oppose the U.S. reversing black and white, confusing right and wrong, and continually refusing to condemn violent terrorist incidents, and instead, making wild accusations about Chinese policy toward ethnic minorities," she said."We hope the U.S. will turn a mirror on itself and all its own domestic problems instead of pointing fingers at other countries."
