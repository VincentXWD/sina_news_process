President Xi Jinping made history as the first Chinese leader to visit Trinidad and Tobago, and his glamorous wife Peng Liyuan helped to turn the trip into a media sensation.Peng is stealing the spotlight as she joins Xi on the visit to the dual island country off the coast of Venezuela, the first stop on a tour that will also take the couple to Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States.Neither rain, the throngs jostling to see the visitors, nor the constant burst of camera flashes chronicling her public appearances flustered the impeccably dressed Chinese first lady, a former opera star fluent in English."She's a very beautiful person, very warm, and to chat with her in English was very wonderful," gushed Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar after meeting Peng.(Agencies)
