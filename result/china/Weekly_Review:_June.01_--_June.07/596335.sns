EU imposes provisional anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels

The European Union (EU) trade commissioner Karel De  Gucht announced Tuesday that the EU has decided to impose provisional  anti-dumping duties on imports of solar panels, cells and wafers from  China.EU imports of Chinese solar products would be subject to a punitive  duty of 11.8 percent from June 6 to Aug. 6, from when on, the duty will  be raised to 47.6 percent, De Gucht said at a press conference."The decision follows a thorough and serious investigation and  extended contacts with market players. As the market for the imports of  solar panels in the EU is very large, it is important for this duty not  to disrupt it," he said.The EU reiterated that in order to "ensure the stability of supply of  solar panels in the short term," the decision was made in two steps in  order to cater to "exceptional circumstances." One week ago, 18 EU  member states voted against a provisional tariff.In a written statement, the European Commission reiterates its  readiness to pursue discussions with Chinese exporters and with the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce to find a solution so that provisional  duties can be suspended.The Alliance for Affordable Solar Energy (AFASE) on Tuesday issued a  petition to De Gucht appealing to halt the tariff. "The EU Commission's  proposed import tariffs on solar panels directly harm the EU's fight  against climate change," the petition letter read."They will make solar energy, a major tool in combating climate change, more expensive than dirty coal or nuclear," it added.After the EU announced its decision, AFASE said it "regrets the  Commission's decision to ignore the considered positions of 18 out of 27  member states voting against duties, based on all the facts available  to them."Even though the Commission has set the preliminary duties lower than  expected for the initial two months, AFASE stressed in a statement that  "any level of tariffs will seriously damage the European solar  industry."The decision to impose duties was taken despite warnings from  hundreds of European solar companies, 15 European photovoltaic (PV)  associations, various trade associations, such as the Federation of  German Industry (BDI) and the German Federation of Wholesale and Foreign  Trade (BGA), the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) as well as many  experts.All of them have spoken out publicly against duties, arguing that  these will harm not only the European solar industry, but the European  economy as a whole.Thorsten Preugschas, CEO of German Soventix GmbH and Chairman of AFASE, sounded alarm against the decision."The current market development leaves no room for price increases.  Therefore, duties of 11.8 percent will put a halt to most of the PV  projects in the EU and cause severe damage to the European solar value  chain," he said.Jodie Roussell, director of public affairs, Europe at Trina Solar,  told Xinhua that a tariff, even as low as 11.8 percent, would harm both  Chinese manufactures and European companies. "One of our clients in  Germany made an assessment showing a tariff rate of 15 percent would  probably kill 85 percent of their business," said Roussell.De Gucht stated that the action would "open the door to negotiate an  amicable solution through 'price-undertakings' within a short period of  time." Roussell welcomed the gesture but said an amicable solution would  need "sincerity on both sides."
