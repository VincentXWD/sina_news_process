A new lighting system using LED bulbs has been installed to illuminate the Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris.Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, lit by LED lights made by Japanese manufacturer Toshiba, was shown to the media on Tuesday.Representatives from Toshiba used a replica of the painting to explain the system.The new system uses 34 LED lights arranged to evenly highlight the painting. The color tone was adjusted with the cooperation of Louvre curators.The new lighting helps to make the Mona Lisa's skin tone more vivid and the lake and forest in the background look clearer.The use of infrared and ultraviolet rays is kept to a minimum to protect the painting.Louvre Managing Director Herve Barbaret says he thinks the new technology has restored the original state of the work that Da Vinci wanted to express.(Agencies)
