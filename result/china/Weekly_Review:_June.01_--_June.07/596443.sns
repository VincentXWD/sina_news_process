Keisuke Honda fired Japan into the 2014 World Cup yesterday with a dramatic injury-time penalty which salvaged a 1-1 draw with Australia in Saitama and made it the first team to qualify alongside host Brazil.Tommy Oar's fortuitous late strike had looked set to condemn the host to an undeserved loss. But after Matthew McKay handled in the box, Honda drove his spot-kick down the middle to earn the necessary point.The result left the Asian champion seven points clear and uncatchable in Group B, putting it through to its fifth straight World Cup. It is the first time it has sealed qualification on home soil."I was nervous. I tried to hit the shot to the center," said Honda. "If it was saved, there was nothing I could do about it."Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni, who joined Japan after the 2010 World Cup, said his attractive Blue Samurai side would "surprise the world" at next year's tournament in Brazil. "I came to Japan to bring them to the World Cup - that was my bottom line," said the Italian. "I feel relieved that I achieved it. We are going to improve further and surprise the world."Holger Osieck's Australia, meanwhile, will be glad of the point away from home as it scraps with Jordan, Oman and Iraq for the second automatic qualifying spot. The third-placed team will go into a playoff.The Blue Samurai dominated for long spells but Australia hung on and Oar put it in front in the 81st minute when his cross from the left looped over Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima, who flapped and failed to clear.McKay was then adjudged to have handled a cross from Honda in the penalty area in stoppage time and the bleach blond CSKA Moscow attacker stepped up to score.(Agencies)
