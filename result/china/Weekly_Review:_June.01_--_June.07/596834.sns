North Korea has drawn up legislation to set up special economic zones. The move is an apparent attempt to lure foreign investments and rebuild the economy.North Korea's official media reported the creation of the law on Wednesday.The report says foreign corporations and individuals will be allowed to set up businesses in the zones. The law covers the industrial, agricultural and tourist sectors.The report says the law guarantees free business activities and protects the rights and assets of foreign investors. It also offers preferential use of land, employment and taxes.The report says foreign investment will be encouraged in infrastructure, high-end technology and manufacturing.But the report says the new law does not cover the Kaesong industrial complex operated with South Korea.North Korea unilaterally withdrew more than 50,000 workers from the Kaesong complex in April, forcing the whole district to close down.Analysts say it will be extremely difficult to dispel distrust among foreign investors.(Agencies)
