2013-06-06 03:11:39 GMT
Michael Jackson's daughter Paris is only 15, but she's already been through a lot. Still, her unsuccessful suicide attempt came as a surprise, because she seemed like a relatively well-adjusted teen.What's more puzzling is that Paris's cry for help happened because she was told she wasn't allowed to attend a Marilyn Manson concert, according to "Entertainment Tonight."Take a look back at how her life has played out so far.April 3, 1998: Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson is born to the legendary entertainer Michael Jackson and Jackson's friend, nurse Debbie Rowe. Paris is the second child (Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., known as Prince, was born in 1997) and the first daughter of the King of Pop.[Related: Photos of Paris Jackson Growing Up in the Spotlight]Early 2000s: Paris and her siblings (a third child, Prince Michael Jackson II, known as Blanket, was born in 2002) are forced to wear masks anytime they go out in public with their dad, so they won' be recognized. Paris later explained to Oprah that, "I appreciated it. It wasn't always comfortable, but yes."June 25, 2009: Michael Jackson dies at his rented L.A. home after he ingests too much of the sedative Propofol, leaving Paris and her siblings without a father.July 7, 2009: Paris and her brothers are unveiled to the world at massive public funeral attended by thousands (many more wanted tickets) while standing beside their aunts and uncles at the podium. "Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine," shares the 11-year-old Paris. "And I just want to say I love him so much." Paris and the other Jackson kids go to live with their grandmother, Michael's mother Katherine, and her guardianship is made official by the court the following month.December 2011: It's announced that Paris is joining the ensemble cast of the upcoming movie "Lundon's Bridge and the Three Keys," based on a children's fantasy book. She appears to be adapting to life without her dad, and seems happy as she appears alongside her brothers to honor her father at tribute ceremonies. The following month, Paris is photographed playing softball for her exclusive private school, the Buckley School in L.A.June 10, 2012: During an interview with Oprah Winfrey that airs on "Oprah's next Chapter," Paris reveals that she sometimes gets bullied. "[They are] at school and some people try to cyber bully me," Paris reveals. "They try to get to me with words, but that doesn't really work."July 22, 2012: The Twitter fiend posts that her grandmother is missing. "i haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now," Paris writes. Katherine's nephew Trent files a missing person's report with the sheriff's department in L.A.July 23, 2012: Katherine is located at a spa in Arizona, which she was allegedly tricked into going to by four of her children. The matriarch hadn't realized that her grandchildren were trying to reach her.July 24, 2012: Video surfaces showing the Jackson family, including Paris, at the Jackson family home while sorting out Michael's $50 million estate, which he left primarily to his children. The blurry video supposedly depicts Paris and Janet in an argument, with Janet slapping Paris in the face and calling her a "spoiled little b---h." (The cops are later called to break up a fight between other members of the family.) Previously, Janet had been vocal in interviews about the fact she did not want Paris to be an actress, but to instead focus on being a kid.July 25, 2012: A judge appoints Paris's cousin, Tito Joe "T.J." Jackson, as the guardian of the Jackson kids in the absence of Katherine.July 26, 2012: "grandma's here! #thankyougod," Paris tweets, adding "5 hours of sleep last night, been awake for 23 ... time to #hibernate."July 27, 2012: Custody of Paris, as well as her brothers, will be shared between Katherine and T.J., it's announced.September 2012: By now, Paris has a prolific Twitter following of more than 1.15 million people and appears regularly in magazines. In a new interview with Glamour magazine, she says that, "I love my dad, and I'm proud to be his daughter. I just don't think the title 'M.J.'s daughter' fits me." She also praises her aunt La Toya's encouragement of her acting career. "Aunt La Toya believes in me," Paris shares.Early 2013: Paris unveils a new look — via Twitter, of course — with a short and sassy haircut, body art on her back, and a thick ear piercing in February. But by the next month, she's snapped supporting her school's basketball team in a cheerleading uniform. Around this time, she changes direction on the career front and says she wants to be a heart surgeon.April 29, 2013: A lawsuit the family has brought against concert promoter AEG begins in downtown L.A. The family claims that Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Michael's death, was brought on by the company. Michael's drug use is described in detail. Both Paris and her older brother Prince are expected to be called as witnesses in the case.May 26, 2013: The now 15-year-old Paris is spotted bonding with her mother Debbie Rowe at Rowe's ranch in Palmdale, California. She's been spotted bonding with her mother several times in recent weeks.June 5, 2013: Paris is rushed to the hospital with cuts on her wrist after an apparent suicide attempt. Her last tweet before it happened was a lyric from a song by the Beatles, a group her father loved. "Yesterday , all my troubles seemed so far away. now it looks as though they're here to stay," she wrote. And just four days earlier, she had posted a makeup tutorial online in which she complained about acne and applied drug store cosmetics, and gave no indication that she was feeling suicidal. A source tells "Entertainment Tonight" that Paris made the attempt after she was told that she wouldn't be allowed to attend a Marilyn Manson concert on June 6. Fortunately, a Jackson source tells CNN that the teen is "going to be okay."Agencies
