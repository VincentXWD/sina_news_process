CHINESE citizens arrested earlier this week for illegal gold mining in Ghana are to be deported, a spokesman for the country's immigration service said last night.The 161 miners were arrested between Saturday and Wednesday, bringing the total number of Chinese arrested in the African nation within the past month to 181.China had complained to Ghana's president after 124 Chinese citizens were detained in a crackdown on illegal mining, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters yesterday.Ghana is Africa's second biggest gold producer after South Africa. As prices have hit record levels in recent years, the sector has been increasingly plagued by illegal miners, including a rising number of Chinese immigrants.The foreign ministry said it urged proper treatment for those detained."Law enforcement agencies should enforce the law in a civilized manner and avoid injuring or damaging the interests of Chinese citizens," it said.
