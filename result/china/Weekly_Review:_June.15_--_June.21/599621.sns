The Hong Kong government Saturday said it will handle the case of the US whistleblower and former CIA contractor Edward Snowden in accordance with the law while taking a decision over his stay.Breaking his silence on Snowden affair, the Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said, "When the relevant mechanism is activated, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will handle the case of Snowden in accordance with the laws and established procedures of Hong Kong".He was quoted as saying so by the South China Morning Post.The statement comes after days of silence on the matter amid mounting public and political pressure on the city's leaders to take some sort of position after one of the biggest whistleblowers in US history chose Hong Kong as a refuge from a criminal case Washington is building against him.Snowden went to Hong Kong on May 20 and later accused Washington of carrying out cyber attacks on China and Hong Kong.Washington has not officially sought Snowden's extradition yet.Referring to Snowden's allegation that US carried cyber attacks on Kong Kong, Leung pledged that the government would "follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of the institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated".The Post report said officials denied reports that Hong Kong and US government lawyers are working together to deal with Snowden's case.(Agencies)
