Celebs reveal the best advice they ever got from their dads
2013-06-17 07:51:27 GMT
In honor of Father's Day, Julie Bowen, Lauren Conrad, LaToya Jackson, and other stars share nuggets of wisdom they've received from their dads.Lauren Conrad: He told me to do something that I really loved because if you do something you love, you don't work a day in your life. I work some days. But he always stressed the importance, with all of his kids, of pursuing a passion. He'd say life is too short to spend your life in a job that you don't even like.Julie Bowen ("Modern Family"): He told me once to take the C and live forever. That was in reference to the fact that I was very, very driven in school as kid and I was determined to get straight As, and a B sent me into fits of despair. He would call me tightly wrapped, which was a nice way of saying a little neurotic. I remember he said to me take the C — the C grade — and live forever, as opposed to fighting for the A and killing yourself. This is not advice that I necessarily took, but it's advice that has stayed with me.La Toya Jackson: Whatever you do, make sure you be the best at it and try and do your best. You are a part of this business ... show business. If you don’t like it then get out of it, because when people walk up to you and ask for your autograph or a picture, you give it to them no matter what, because that’s the business you’re in.Celebrity Chef Mario Batali: The best advice I've ever gotten from my father probably was something along the lines of: Keep your head down and get back in there, because you're doing good. And that's just it: Any time there's something that seems to come against you, you just keep going at it. You do the best you can, you smile, and you make the best of the situation.Mayim Bialik ("The Big Bang Theory"): The best advice my father ever gave me is sports-related — Shake it off. I was really really athletic and as a kid at at the time it seemed weird to be told to kind of shake off injuries and get back in the saddle, but it’s actually served me sort of emotionally to remember that notion of shaking it off and getting back up, so I think that’s pretty good advice from my dad.Connie Britton ("Nashville"): The best advice that my dad ever gave me is that there is no shortage of paper. This was back when we used paper instead of computers. He wanted me to know that I could write everything down and didn't have to worry about making everything fit into small boxes.Singer Cher Lloyd: My dad's always been very open-minded and he's basically let me fly away, has let me leave the nest. The advice that he gave me was to do what I want and to put my foot down in situations that I feel are important to me. And he basically made sure that I am able to be a very strong and independent woman.Dan Bucatinsky ("Scandal"): Chew 20 times before swallowing. Good for metabolism. And don't ever give up. That was a good one. He passed away three years ago, so I think about that one a lot. And I'm a dad now, so I tell my kids the same thing. We don't give up. We just keep trying and we keep going.Whitney Port ("The City"): My dad [who passed away this year] was constantly giving me advice. We worked together and he was in the apparel industry so he basically oversaw our whole company until the end. What he would say to me is mostly to take time to make the connections to people. He would also tell me to not give up and that as long as I could continue to maintain the company and maintain a path moving forward that I need to just show up. And that half the battle is just showing up.Katie Lowes ("Scandal"): My dad is definitely lead by example. He's a freelance photographer, so he's an artist like I'm an artist, and I've seen the highs and the lows, and I've seen it all. He's always been a good person. He's nice to everybody, he's a really hard worker, and I try to embody that daily.Agencies
