China rejects spy claims against Snowden

A Chinese foreign ministry  spokeswoman on Monday described as "sheer nonsense" claims that a former  U.S. intelligence contractor who is hiding in Hong Kong was an agent of  China. Hua Chunying made the comment at a daily press briefing after former  U.S. vice president Dick Cheney expressed suspicion Sunday that Edward  Snowden chose Hong Kong because he was an agent of China. "This is sheer nonsense," Hua said. The 29-year-old former CIA-employee fled Hong Kong on May 20 after  exposing two classified U.S. National Security Agency surveillance  programs, one collecting U.S. phone records and the other mining  Internet data. In Hong Kong, he provided The Guardian with top-secret documents that  has led to a series of revelations about the extent of U.S.  surveillance, to which several nations, including U.S. allies, have  demanded explanations. "The United States should take the concerns and demands of the  international community and the public over this issue seriously, and  give a necessary explanation," said the spokeswoman.    China yesterday demanded that Washington explain its monitoring programs to the international community. Several nations, including United States allies, have reacted angrily to revelations by an ex-CIA employee over a week ago that US authorities had tapped the servers of Internet companies for personal data. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the US - which has complained about alleged cyber-espionage by China - owed the world an explanation. "We believe the United States should pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation," Hua told reporters at a daily news briefing. The revelations of the US National Security Agency's spying programs were provided by Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor currently in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong. Snowden told the South China Morning Post last week that Americans had spied extensively on targets in China's mainland and Hong Kong. He said these included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the site of an exchange which handles nearly all the city's domestic web traffic. At the briefing, Hua rejected a suggestion that Snowden was a spy for China. "This is sheer nonsense," she said. Her comments came after former US Vice President Dick Cheney said that he was "deeply suspicious" about Snowden's decision to go to China, although Hong Kong has its own legal system. (Agencies)
