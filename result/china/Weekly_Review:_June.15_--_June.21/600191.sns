In an advert and letters, Liu Boqin, an ageing former Red Guard from Shandong province,  confesses that he beat teachers and terrorised families, and now understood 'sins of the Cultural Revolution'.The latest edition of the liberal monthly Yanhuang Chunqiu published the ad and two related letters to the editor from Liu Boqin last week, prompting a wide discussion online."I was naive, easily bamboozled, and never distinguished good from bad," Liu confessed in a letter.Liu said he beat teachers, spat on them, and terrorised some families. He also played practical jokes on his neighbours, such as throwing firecrackers into their courtyards in the dead of night."As I grow older, I have a more profound understanding of the sins of the Cultural Revolution," he wrote. "I cannot forget what I've done wrong."Years after that tumultuous period, which ran from 1966 to 1976, Liu has searched for those he once attacked as a Red Guard. He said that he was able to apologise to some victims and received forgiveness.His letter lists nine names. "I want to apologise to all victims and their families to obtain psychological relief. An open letter is simple and clear," he wrote.Zhu Xueqin, a history professor at Shanghai University, said it was significant that an open apology from a former Red Guard had been published at this moment."It reminds us that it's necessary to dig deeper for the systematic reasons that caused the Cultural Revolution," he said.
