Actress Angelina Jolie has returned to work as a humanitarian a month after stunning the world with her double mastectomy revelation by jetting off to Jordan in celebration of World Refugee Day.On Tuesday she traveled to the Middle East for an official visit as an ambassador with the United Nations.The actress met with a number of women and children fleeing war-torn Syria, and listened to their stories as they expressed the pain of losing their homes and loved ones amid the hostilities.She also spoke with Major General Hussein Al-Zyoud, who helps control the border between Jordan and Syria, and called for more humanitarian aid ahead of World Refugee Day on Thursday.She said, “The worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century is unfolding in the Middle East today. The international response to this crisis falls short of the vast scale of this human tragedy. Much more humanitarian aid is needed, and above all, a political settlement to this conflict must be found.”Jolie last visited the Jordanian border in December.Agencies
