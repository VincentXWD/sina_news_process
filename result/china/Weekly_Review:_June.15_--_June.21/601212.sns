Seven people were injured in a stampede when at least 1,000 fans and students struggled to enter a Shanghai university sports stadium to see British soccer star David Beckham Thursday afternoon.Three police officers, two students and two campus security staff of Tongji University fell over and were injured in the melee at 2:40 pm, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said on its official microblog.A university press officer, surnamed Huang, told the Global Times they had underestimated the number of people who would come to the event, despite giving it little publicity. Students had apparently published details of the event on social media, which spread rapidly on campus.One Japanese student has already left the Xinhua Hospital, while the rest are still receiving treatment. The hospital said in a press release that the four males and two females are under observation, and one of them suffered an injury to the eye and nose."The crowd got crazy and lost control when Beckham appeared. Everyone tried to get inside the stadium to follow Beckham when the gate opened. You couldn't leave because the crowd forced you to move forward," said Zhou Tianyi, a Tongji University student.Zhou said the event host used the broadcast system to inform the crowd that there were people injured, and fans made a path for them to get out. He added that not everyone present was a student, as the school did not ask for a ticket to attend the event, slated to start at 2 pm.Ge Shengjie, press officer with the university police department under the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, said officers were sent to the event at the school's request, but said it was unclear that how many officers were dispatched.The Global Times reporter found no more than 30 police officers and security staff before the chaos happened.Beckham left the stadium five minutes after he showed up, barely making it to the pitch when the event was canceled. He was scheduled to meet with the school's football team, and another local juvenile team for the event.He said on his official microblog that he had "an incredible response from everyone at Shanghai Tongji University," and wished the fans a speedy recovery.
