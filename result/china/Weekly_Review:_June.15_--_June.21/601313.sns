By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishKai-fu Lee, former head of Google China before the search giant pulled out of the country, denied accusations that he was involved in the Prism project, which triggged controversy and heated debate in the past week after a US whistleblower exposed the secret monitoring program.Lee said in a message posted on Sina Weibo, a twitter-like Chinese microblogging service, that he knew nothing about Prism and never met US intelligence officials while working for Google, in response to Chinese general Dai Xu's accusation on Weibo that under Lee's leadership, Google Earth spied on China's military base in Sanya, the Dongfeng-21 missile and a military drill conducted in East China.Dai Xu, a senior Col. of the People's Liberation Army, is known for his "outspoken" views on politics and international affairs. In April, he sparked online outrage by saying the H7N9 bird flu, which killed dozens of Chinese people since its outbreak, is the newest US bioweapon against China.This time around, Dai said he has always found Lee "suspicious" and the exposion by Edward Snowden of US worldwide hacking program finally made him realize Lee's "ulterior motives" behind his criticism of the Chinese government.To support his claims, he cited a report in US magazine Foreign Policy, which said "a highly secretive unit of the National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. government's huge electronic eavesdropping organization, called the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China."The Chinese general noted the "15 years" in particular and said the timing is perfect: Lee has been living in China for "15 years" since Lee moved to Microsoft and came to Beijing in 1998 and that's evidence that he is an "American eye"."Prism makes it clear that all US internet companies, electronic products and those who have obtained US citizenship but live in China are potential "American eyes," Dai wrote in a microblog post."Now Chinese people should know Kai-fu Lee's true identity and his secret mission here."In response, Lee called Dai's accusations "personal attacks" and listed four reasons why he was not involved in the Prism.-1. Upon its entrance of the Chinese market, Google China said clearly in its testimonial that "We will not maintain on Chinese soil any services, like email, that involve personal or confidential data."-2. All employees of Google China, including myself, are prohibited from viewing personal data stored in foreign data centers.-3. Google said only a few has access to NSA.-4. I do not have the required security clearance. Never heard of Prism or similar programs, or met officers from US intelligence department.On June 18,  Lee wrote in a blog on Caijing Magazine's website titled "Chinese Netizens React Strongly to Prism", in which he called for the US government to "respond with a comprehensive response".Â
