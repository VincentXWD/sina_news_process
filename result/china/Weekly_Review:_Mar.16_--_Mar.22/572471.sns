Ding Junhui staged a stunning comeback from 3-0 down to claim a remarkable 4-3 victory over Neil Robertson in the final of the Dafabet Players Tour Championship Grand Finals in Galway.Ding had been in brilliant form during the tournament, including scoring a maximum 147 in the quarter-finals, but looked to finish empty-handed as world No 3 Robertson stormed into a three-frame lead.The Australian won the first with a break of 88 after Ding had made a decent start, took the second with a break of 58 and then claimed the third with a half-century clearance.At that point last season's runner-up Robertson looked on course to follow the 4-0 whitewashes secured by Stephen Lee and Shaun Murphy in the previous two finals, but Chinese ace Ding had other ideas.The 2011 Masters champion showed he was far from beaten with breaks of 52 and 70 in winning the fourth frame, and then a brilliant 130 - his eighth century of the tournament - saw him reduce the deficit to 3-2.It was all-square soon after and, with the momentum behind him, Ding clinched the title with a break of 98 in the deciding frame.The victory earned Ding his sixth ranking title of his career and first since winning the Welsh Open over a year ago.He told www.worldsnooker.com: 'I have played well all week. It was very tough because I had to win four matches in the last frame."I have taken my chances, made big breaks and fought back in matches," he said."I have more experience now and I know I can win close matches with just one chance. It's all about thinking, and keeping my concentration.""I have been working hard all year. I might have a few tournaments when I don't play well and have less energy, but I know I can come back strong."(Agencies)
