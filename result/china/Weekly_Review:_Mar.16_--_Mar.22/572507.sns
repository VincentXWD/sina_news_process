Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay state visits to Russia, Tanzania, South Africa and the Republic of Congo on March 22-30.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang made the announcement in Beijing on Monday.Xi is making the visit at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, South African President Jacob Zuma and President of the Republic of Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso.Xi will also attend the fifth leaders' summit of BRICS countries, to be held from March 26 to 27 in Durban, South Africa.BRICS is an economic bloc representing five of the world's leading emerging economies, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.President Xi’s wife to play an important role on international stageWhen President Xi travels to South Africa later this month, he will be accompanied by his wife, an act to build Chinese “soft power”, UK's Financial Times (FT) said.Peng Liyuan, famous in China for her performances of patriotic songs, will have her own speaking engagement as Xi attends the Brics summit in Durban, according to FT.“She will make an independent appearance,” a friend of Ms Peng was quoted as saying. Another person briefed on plans for the trip added: “She can help China build soft power.”From John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama, US presidents have used their spouses to help improve their image at home and abroad. But the decision by the "easy-going" Xi to break with Chinese tradition signals his recognition that China must find new ways to make friends.“Just as China needs to learn more about the world, so does the world need to learn more about China,” President Xi said in November, after becoming head of the Chinese Communist party.
