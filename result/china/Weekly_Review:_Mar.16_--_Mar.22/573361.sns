China's plan to build a nuclear powered aircraft carrier using reactors of existing submarines has led to alarm bells ringing as the warships could be used to patrol the Indian Ocean, according to Indian media.It said that Chinese military's biggest shipyard was going to build a nuclear powered aircraft carrier with reactors probably based on its existing submarine reactors.Preparations had been obvious since 2008 when a submarine base began operations on Hainan Island on the South China Sea, close to the Malacca Straits. In recent months, speculation about China pressing the Maldives to allow a submarine base has intensified. Then there is the Chinese airfield project in Hambantota in Sri Lanka and recently Pakistan's Gwadar Port was dredged to a depth of 14 metre to allow large vessels to dock.Retired Indian Rear Admiral Raja Menon said, "These are potential places, but whether they become bases, that's a big leap, because that means accepting Indian hostility to giving a base to China."Dr Sreekanth Kondapalli, Chinese Navy analyst, said, "Being a regional local navy and power, India has huge territorial advantage by being closer to the IOR, yet India cannot claim ownership to the region because it is the third largest ocean with open navigation principles."(Agencies)
