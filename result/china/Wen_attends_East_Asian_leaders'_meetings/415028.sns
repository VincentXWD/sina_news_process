by Xia Wenhui, Xu YuenaiBEIJING, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Thursday is holding a summit on the Indonesian island of Bali, to be followed by a series of meetings attended by East Asian and Pacific nation leaders.ASEAN nations' development is conducive to regional stability and prosperity, and beneficial relations between ASEAN and neighboring countries is also important for a consistent achievement of ASEAN's goal.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China-ASEAN dialogue. When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao attends the meetings, as always, he will bring China's unswerving commitment to strategic cooperation between China and ASEAN.China's current ties with ASEAN nations are unprecedented. China has maintained close high-level exchanges to enhance all-round cooperation with ASEAN. On the economy and trade, China and ASEAN are striving through a free trade agreement to achieve the goal of 500 billion U.S. dollars in bilateral trade in 2015. It's no exaggeration that China-ASEAN's relationship is a model for international cooperation.It's very reasonable that good friends also have differences. One of the reasons for creating ASEAN was to deal with various issues facing the member nations, and that's why the regional mechanism has included the 10+1 and 10+3 leaders meetings and the East Asia Summit, which aim to discuss and solve traditional and new issues.Indonesia, the host nation at this year's meetings, is a special place. It was where, in 1955, then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai initiated together with leaders of other Asian and African countries the Bandung spirit.The core of the Bandung spirit of seeking common ground while shelving differences and embracing peaceful coexistence is still a practical way to solve disputes.Asia's development and stability needs a coordinator. ASEAN's development now shows good momentum, with a stable regional situation and economic development. As the ASEAN Anthem goes, "for peace, our goal from the very start, and prosperity to last". Peace and prosperity is the ultimate goal of the region.For this, the Southeast Asian nations should stick to the guideline of cooperation and cover disputes and difficulties with collective wisdom and effort for a brighter future for all on the way to peace and prosperity.
