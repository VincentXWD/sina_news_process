China and ASEAN, Wen said, also should keep their destiny firmly in their hands and not slacken pace or waver in their advance in the direction they have set to pursue their goals.To promote the future growth of China-ASEAN practical cooperation, Wen outlined a six-point proposal: expand cooperation in trade and investment;give high priority to connectivity and other infrastructural development; deepen financial cooperation; expand practical maritime cooperation;advance cooperation in science, technology and sustainable development;work harder to promote cooperation in social areas and areas important to people's livelihood.BOOSTING HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF EAST ASIAN COOPERATIONOver the years, East Asia has witnessed the simultaneous development of various mechanisms including ASEAN, 10+1, 10+3, the trilateral summit between China, Japan and South Asia, and the East Asian Summit, Yang said.During Wen's attendance at the series of meetings, the premier repeatedly stressed that East Asian nations should regard ASEAN as the dominant power of cooperation, highlight the theme of development, mutual benefit and win-win results, and strengthen the cohesion and momentum of development for the mechanisms of 10+1 and 10+3, Yang said.Wen also put forward a number of important initiatives concerning the region's pragmatic cooperation, which were well lauded by participants at the meetings, Yang said.Speaking at the 14th ASEAN Plus Three Summit, Wen lauded the important role of 10+3 cooperation in successfully navigating the international financial crisis, maintaining fairly fast economic growth and financial stability, and deepening economic integration in East Asia.Meanwhile, he put forward a four-point proposal on 10+3 cooperation: accelerating trade liberalization and facilitation in East Asia;
