RIO DE JANEIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Rio+20 Secretary-general Sha Zukang has called for efforts to build sustainable cities, describing it as one of the important issues in achieving sustainable development, according to a press release seen here on Tuesday.Sha, also UN under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs, made the remarks here at a Monday forum on electric mobility and sustainable human settlements, a key associated event of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio+20.The release said Sha pointed out in his speech that mobility is one of the prerequisites of sustainable development and that building sustainable human settlements is an important issue closely connected to the challenges to be discussed at Rio+20.Sustainable human settlements will help people respond to and relieve the effects of climate change, develop green economy and reduce poverty, he was quoted as saying.Increasing urbanization and more and more motor vehicles lead to congestion and huge energy consumption, while exhaust emissions pollute the air of cities, affect human health and contribute to climate change, Sha noted.The senior UN official stressed the need to help policymakers and the public have a better understanding of green mobility and sustainable cities.Every one, including governments, enterprises and consumers, should make efforts to help build sustainable cities, he added.The Global Forum on Electric Mobility and Conference on Sustainable Human Settlements was co-organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the Global Forum on Human Settlements (GFHS), relevant Brazilian enterprises and educational and research institutes, and other parties.During the event, Global Human Settlements Awards were given to 14 cities, enterprises and individuals from around the world.
