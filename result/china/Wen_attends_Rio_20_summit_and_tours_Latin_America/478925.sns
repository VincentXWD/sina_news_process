"The more it develops, the more opportunities China will create and the more contribution it will make to the world," he said.China will help other developing countries raise capacity for environmental protection, ecological preservation and desertification control, Wen said.He said promoting sustainable development is a great cause that will benefit both current and future generations and pledged that China will work with the international community to share opportunities and meet challenges.The Rio+20 summit is another large-scale high-level international conference on sustainable development following the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa.The Rio+20 summit aims to review the progress made in sustainable development over the past 20 years and act urgently in the face of the global financial crisis, reiterate political commitments and address new problems and challenges for sustainable development.More than 120 heads of state or government and over 40,000 representatives are attending the summit.Related:Chinese premier calls for deeper strategic mutual trust with IndiaWen: 100m Chinese live in poverty
