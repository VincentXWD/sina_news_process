SANTIAGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's recent speech at the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) served to consolidate ties between China and Latin America, a top ECLAC official said Wednesday.In an interview with Xinhua, ECLAC Director of International Trade and Integration Osvaldo Rosales described Wen's address on Tuesday in Santiago as "very substantial, very timely, because it consolidates the economic, trade and investment ties between China and Latin America."Wen made a series of proposals in his speech and called for the promotion of strategic cooperation, trade, and food security between the two sides.It showed there is a dialogue between China and the region as a whole, said Rosales.Wen also proposed a meeting this year with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).That proposal serves to bolster regional integration, said Rosales,"because what he is really saying is: 'organize yourselves and we will hold talks based on an integrated regional agenda'.""To use a sports term, the ball is now in Latin America's court," he said, the region should coordinate closely in a bid to respond to those substantial proposals by Premier Wen.In his speech, Wen announced that China will allocate 5 billion dollars to initiate a China-Latin America cooperation fund and will also initiate a 10-billion-dollar special loan to support infrastructure cooperation.Rosales said that China is spearheading its relationship with the region.Now it is up to countries in the region to live up to the challenges of promoting diversification, innovation, infrastructure and a special policy with the resources to integrate with China, he concluded."China imports our natural resources, which allows us to grow...... making the most of China's dynamism."ECLAC is a regional economic committee under the UN Economic and Social Council, with an aim to promote regional economic and social development and boost economic cooperation between its 44 member countries.
