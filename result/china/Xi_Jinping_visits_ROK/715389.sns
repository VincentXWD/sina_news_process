I believe the pact will be established before the end of this year," said Shen Minghui, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies.Zhuang Rui, deputy dean of the Institute of International Economy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that progress is "slower than expected and the pact should be signed as soon as possible".China and South Korea launched the FTA negotiations on May 2, 2012. The 11th round of talks was held in Sichuan province in late May.

"While South Korea is reluctant to lower its tariffs on agricultural products, China is concerned about opening services sectors," he said.China is the largest trading partner of South Korea. China-South Korea trade volume has been more than the combined value of South Korea's trade with the United States, the European Union and Japan.In the January-May period, trade between China and South Korea rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier to $115 billion. South Korea's direct investment in China surged 88.3 percent year-on-year while China's investment in South Korea surged 180 percent, according to the ministry."The establishment of a China-South Korea FTA will provide a modality as well as a driving force for the progress of a China-Japan-South Korea FTA and a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership," Shen said.The three countries are holding negotiations on a trilateral FTA. They are also negotiators for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that covers 16 economies in Asia.Economic integration in East Asia is facing difficulties in recent years and a bilateral FTA will "advance trade and investment facilitation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership framework", Zhuang said.Shen cited some sensitive areas in the talks.
