Commentators laud prospects of an enhanced bilateral relationshipPresident Xi Jinping's just-concluded two-day visit to South Korea has boosted ties and contributed to regional peace and stability, analysts say.Kim Han-kwon, director of the Center for China Studies at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in South Korea, said Xi's visit has deepened the two countries' cooperation in such fields as security, economics and culture."It is a boost not only to the political trust between leaders of the two countries but also to the friendship between the two peoples," he said.The director called on both nations to maximize their common core interests, put aside differences and seek common ground.Cha Jae-bok, a researcher with the Northeast Asian History Foundation of South Korea, said Xi's visit is of great significance to relations, and especially economic ties.During the visit, the two sides signed a deal on establishing arrangements for the Chinese yuan's clearance in Seoul and agreed to push for the completion of negotiations on a free-trade agreement by year-end.Those decisions will boost South Korea's financial markets and promote the process of economic integration among Asian countries, Cha said.Shin Seong-ho, associate dean of the Office of International Affairs at Seoul National University, said Xi's speech at his university gave a broad and in-depth blueprint of the development of Asia and the whole world, rather than solely focusing on South Korea-China ties.Kyung Hee University professor Ha Young-ae said the visit has bolstered South Korean public confidence in ties.Japanese political commentator Jiro Honzawa said Xi's visit could serve to contain Japan's right wing. The deepening of ties could help safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and all of East Asia, he said.His views were shared by Qian Feng, vice-director of Thailand's Chinese-language newspaper Asian Daily."The two heads of state reached consensus on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which laid a foundation for regional stability," he said.During his South Korea visit on Thursday and Friday, Xi met with a number of South Korean leaders and politicians, and the two sides confirmed over 90 cooperation programs covering 23 fields.
