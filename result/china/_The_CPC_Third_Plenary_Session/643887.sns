Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged a key university to make more efforts in fostering high-quality military talent and developing innovative science and technology projects.Xi made the remarks Tuesday during an inspection at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), which is based in the city of Changsha in central China's Hunan Province.The NUDT, which evolved from the Military Engineering Institute of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) founded in 1953, has played a key role in providing high-caliber military technicians and developing advanced weapons and equipment for the country.While visiting an exhibition of various science and technology projects by the NUDT, Xi praised the university for its fruitful innovation drive, urging the university's technology innovation personnel to continue its hard work and strive for more achievement.In June, the NUDT announced that it had again built the world's fastest supercomputer, the Tianhe-2, capable of performing 33.86 quadrillion operations per second and surpassing the U.S. Titan supercomputer.The computer's predecessor, the Tianhe-1A, was the world's fastest supercomputer from November 2010 to June 2011, when it was surpassed by Japan's K computer.Stressing ideological and political work as a major supporting force in realizing the goal of strengthening the army, Xi said that the goal should be embedded in all stages and aspects of the university's operation.Xi called for a strong sense of politics among officers and soldiers, urging them to "unwaveringly uphold the basic principle and system of the army under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC)."Xi stressed that the army should keep pace with the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission and resolutely listen to their command.Meanwhile, Xi told the university to research the characteristics and patterns of modern military education and boost educational quality so as to foster more military talent to shoulder the heavy task of reinforcing the army.According to Xi, the NUDT should coordinate its scientific research capacity and resources while ensuring that science and technology innovation are closely linked with real combat and army service.In addition, Xi urged the university to uphold a sound campus spirit in order to promote the comprehensive development of its officers and soldiers in morals, wisdom, physical fitness and aesthetics.
