More than 71 percent of respondents support abolition of misused vehicles for officials, as authorities fight corruption involving government vehicles, according to a survey published on Thursday."Government cars used for private purpose" and "reimbursement of private car expenses" are listed as the most common forms of corruption in use of government vehicles by those surveyed by China Youth Daily.Other gripes include irregular subsidies, waste, purchase of excessively luxurious cars and an excessive number of government vehicles.Respondents blame lax enforcement of existing measures for vehicle-based corruption.As part of the campaign to fight bureaucracy and corruption, the Communist Party of China's disciplinary agency ordered authorities earlier this year to tighten management and standardize the use of government vehicles.The survey sampled 5,109 people and was conducted by the newspaper's survey center via 3g.qq.com.
