Premier Li Keqiang has called for greater efforts to develop the economy and enhance social welfare just days ahead of a much-awaited key policy meeting.The Chinese economy has showed signs of stabilization and strength thanks to measures to accommodate the needs of both the present situation and long-term development, Li said on Tuesday while presiding over a meeting in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.These measures include, among others, streamling administration and delegating powers to lower levels, urban renovation, stabilizing consumer prices and job creation, he said."But more concerted efforts should be made to accomplish this year's major tasks and create favorable conditions for the coming year," he added.Development is the most important task for China and functions as the basis for the solution of all of China's problems, he said, noting that China should pursue scientific development featuring quality growth, efficiency, more jobs and better social welfare.Li stressed the need to keep running the economy "within the reasonable range" and guard against any disturbances that risk derailing the economy.Premier Li also urged greater efforts to enhance social livelihood in a bid to bring the benefits of reform to the people and avoid frequent occurrences of events that disrupt the "psychological bottom line" of society.Acute problems in the field of social welfare must be solved. The pension system, basic medical care as well as social relief and aid must all be enhanced.Heads from the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Fujian, Henan and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were in attendance.The four-day Third Plenary Session of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee will start this Saturday.
