The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on Tuesday founded a 28-member team to promote the key reform plan that it adopted last week, while details about how decisions were reached on major issues of reform emerged on Monday.The promotion team is made up of senior Party and government officials, including ministers, vice ministers and provincial party chiefs, as well as legislators, political advisors and researchers from national think tanks.They will tour the country to explain the decision on major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reform adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee on November 12.President Xi Jinping said in a written instruction to the team that they should help CPC members, officials and ordinary people understand the main principles, new ideas, judgments and measures in the document.The key is to explain why the committee adopted the decision and answer people's questions, said Xi, also the committee's general secretary.In April, after the new leadership was elected, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided that the Third Plenum would deal with comprehensive reform and make decisions.The Political Bureau decided to found a drafting group, headed by President Xi.It was the first time since 2000 that the Party's top leader had led the drafting of a document to be tabled at a plenary session.At the first meeting of the drafting group, Xi asked them to make a strategic plan for deepening reforms in all aspects, based on a good understanding of the country's new circumstances, reality, missions and people's expectations.At a number of meetings from April to July, Xi instructed the drafting group to produce a landmark document that could be tested by the people, the real world and the times.During this period, the Standing Committee met three times and the Political Bureau members met twice to discuss the draft. All meetings were presided over by Xi.On July 25, the first draft decision was submitted to the seven members of the Standing Committee. It was later amended a number of times.On September 4, the draft was distributed to more than 100 departments at the central and local levels for opinions. Former Party and State leaders also contributed to the draft.Later Xi met with representatives of non-communist parties, including the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and those without party affiliation to hear their suggestions.From September 4, the drafting group received a total of 2,564 proposals and more than 40 percent were included in the final document.On October 29, the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau reviewed the draft and decided to submit it to the third plenary session.On November 9 when the third plenary session opened, Xi explained the decision. In the following four days, 204 members of the CPC Central Committee and 169 alternate members discussed the document in depth.On the evening of November 11, the members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau met one last time to hear the proposals gathered during the session and decide on a new draft that went to panel discussions on the morning of November 12.
