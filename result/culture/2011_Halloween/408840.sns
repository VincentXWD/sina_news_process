Randy Able Stable on country music in Beijing 
2011-10-27 03:06:34 GMT
Bluegrass in Beijing--for Halloween. Catch the Randy Abel Stable, a bunch of honky-tonk, acoustic jamming musicians this Saturday at Yugong Yishan. Because there's nothing like a touch of Deliverance to scare the living daylights out of you ....How does honky-tonk sell to a Chinese audience? I think our Chinese audience members respond to all the styles we play due to the wide acceptance of folk traditions in this culture, and it doesn’t hurt that many start with Hank Williams as a basis for their understanding of real Country Music. Honky Tonk is an easy sell from there.What's your favorite venue to perform in? I’ll have to keep that one close to my chest—too many good friends own and operate too many great joints in this town. I will say, however, that the answer could get easier soon enough; a very Stable venue could start making hay while the sun shines in the foreseeable future.Who writes the songs? So far all the originals we do are mine, but the other guys have their own superb stuff that I often prod them to incorporate. The arrangements for my recent ones have all been collaborations. In the case of this summer’s “Second Bar to the Right (Then Straight On ‘Til Morning),” we worked it out via email while some of the Stablemates were back visiting the States.What's the best crowd-pleaser song? We shake it up so much that it’s hard to pin one down, but right now it seems to be “I Am a Pilgrim,” a gospel tune that I sing as a duet with Stablemate Liu Yusi. His harmonies are absolutely heartbreaking.Who is your favorite artist? Why? The late, great Townes Van Zandt… because this world never knew a better songwriter. And I’ll stand in Merle Haggard’s shitkickers on Steve Earle’s coffee table and scream that into Bob Dylan’s face! (Respectfully, of course.)Where are you from? The buckle of the Rust Belt or nadir of the Rust Bowl—however you want to look at it (and you just might not wanna), between Pittsburgh and Cleveland, where we used to make steel in the days when America made stuff. On the bright side, praise the Muse that my grandad was from southwest Virginia moonshining people on Clinch Mountain, where Country Music was born. His grandad’s grandad is the eponymous subject of my Bluegrass tune “Bluford Abel.”Describe this style of music to a music novice. On stage we often explain, in English and Chinese, that it’s intended to swing enough to get women dancing while at the same time keeping dudes from thinking too much while they go right on ordering the whiskey. Everybody knows that’s our real job.What's next for the Randy Abel Stable? Recording, increasing our Stability, gigging like stallions, anchoring Beijing’s emerging folky scene. We’re proud to throw down for the Sunday Acoustic Nights at D-22. On Friday, October 28th we’ll be at Yugong Yishan’s Halloween bash with our friends Christmas and Not There. Look out for amped-up murder balads and other psychobilly creepiness when we fuel the fires of that epic event!Is there a big country underground in Beijing? Where do cowboys hang out?WE ARE THE BIG COUNTRY UNDERGROUND IN BEIJING.If I told you any more than that I’d have to brand yer hide, dude!The Full Band SpeaksThe Randy Abel Stable are Randy Abel (blues harp/lead vocals), Peter Schloss (banjo/vocals), Parker Trevathan (mandolin/vocals), Josh Dyer (guitar/vocals) and Liu Yusi (guitar/vocals).How do you all know each other?Yusi: Open mics, bluegrass jams here and there.Peter: Randy and I used to get together to eat hot dogs at a stall on NanLuoGuXiang before jam sessions at the Great Leap Brewing Co. We then asked Parker to join us, but he ate burgers instead of hot dogs at the hot dog stand—the burgers are surprisingly good. We then recruited Josh and he doesn't eat gluten; so, obviously, there were more hot dogs and burgers left for us. The crowning moment came when we brought Yusi into the Stable. As he's a vegetarian, it worked out perfectly for us.How did this all come together?Peter: Chris "Bone Daddy" Boehner, formerly of Redbucks fame, somehow got us all onto the same email list which led to the Great Leap jam sessions. The hot dog stand and the rest is history.Parker: If I remember correctly, Randy had a gig offer for a show at The Green Cap in Shunyi, and wanted to put a group together for it. He asked Josh, Peter, and me to join him, and many months later, here we are. Randy recruited Yusi soon after, because he is a stellar musician and a very kindhearted individual.Randy: The addition of Yusi came about soon after we saw him at a VA Bar open mic one Wednesday night. He was accompanying himself on mandolin, doing stuff by Bowie and Stevie Wonder, and later asked us to help kick-start the Hot Cat Club’s Thursday open mics by serving as guest band for the first month. At those events we found our harmonies and interests clicking on Honky Tonk, Country Rock, etc., and started opening up our current stride from there.Who writes the songs? Do you work together on harmonies?Yusi: Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, that mysterious genius named 'Traditional', and, of course, Mr. Randy Abel Stable.Randy: While all the originals we’ve done so far are mine, the other guys have their own superb stuff that I often prod them to incorporate. The arrangements for my recent ones have all been collaborations. In the case of this summer’s Honky Tonk tune, “Second Bar to the Right (Then Straight On ‘Til Morning),” we worked it out via email while some of the Stablemates were back visiting the States.Josh: This music was written by generations of mountain folk, right on down to the present. I can honestly say I think a lot of our harmonies just came together—but I sing the least, so I'm no authority.Parker: A vast majority of the songs are American bluegrass standards or covers of honky tonk, country, singer-songwriter, and even classic rock tunes. Our harmonies tend to sprout organically from trying things out during practice or performance.Peter: We are making it a priority now to work on harmonies as we believe this will set us apart from any pretenders to the throne.I've seen you at a few chill venues, all acoustic, like more of a jam than a set. Why the chill vibe? Is that part of the spirit of bluegrass?Josh: I think our vibe has to do with our insistence on pure acoustic instrumentation, a reverence for traditional material that needs a lighter touch, and the fact that there are a lot of ex-rockers in our band who want to preserve their hearing into old age.Randy: Amen to that.Yusi: I'd tell you that a few years ago I couldn't tell the bluegrass from the blues… and I still can't.Peter: The Great Leap, where we first played together, is the closest thing there is in Beijing to a back-porch. Since back porches are where bluegrass is traditionally played, it’s a perfect vibe for us and our music.Parker: That’s definitely part of the spirit of bluegrass (but many other musical forms and traditions as well), to gather in a circle and toss songs around. It is a beautiful thing that is ages old.Where did you get your gear? Is it made in China?Parker: My instrument is an early-1920s Gibson A-Junior mandolin that I bought in a vintage guitar shop in Houston, Texas, in 1999. It was made in the good ol' U.S. of A.Randy: The harmonicas I play now are Hohners, hand made in Germany and mostly imported from a shop in Austin, Texas, by Stablemate Parker.Josh: I proudly play a Chinese-made Victor guitar which has a few minor intonation issues, but still qualifies as one of the best-sounding acoustic guitars I've ever owned. An absolute bargain. The L. R. Baggs pickup I installed in it required days of searching up and down the music shops on 新街口外大街 and 鼓楼东大街. Expensive but worth it.Yusi: Yeah, made in China, even if you buy it overseas, chances are it's still made in ChinaPeter: Banjos are increasingly easy to find it Beijing, although the quality is exceptionally poor. All of the good quality banjos made in China (in Tianjin, especially) are exported to the US. I play a Recording King banjo, purchased in the US but made in Tianjin. Go figureDo you have matching belt buckles or other gear?Yusi: I have a 'Nudie shirt'.Randy: We all have Nudie boxers.Peter: The only matching things we have are custom-made, red-white-and-blue bowling shirts which we wore when we played at the US Embassy's Independence Day Celebration. We were a sight to behold, no doubt.Josh: The custom bowling shirts haven't made an appearance in a while...Parker: Recently, Josh, Randy, and I have been wearing Country & Western-style shirts to a few gigs, but that's about it (for now).What one band in the city do you tip your hat to?Parker: Tough one. I'll say Ajinai. I saw them at the Ditan Folk Festival last spring, and they were excellent. We've been fortunate to play with the band leader/horse-head fiddle player in both "jam" and gig settings. (A couple hat tips to Shanren and Xiao He, as well.)Yusi: I don't really wear a hat.Randy: I’ll second Parker’s notions, adding that Xiao Hu of Ajinai once joined us on stage for a Mongolian throat-singing solo during our version of the Bluegrass standard “Rollin’ in My Sweet Baby’s Arms.” Best performance moment ever.Peter: My current favorite is Out of Control (although I have not seen them on the circuit for awhile).Josh: Sorry, I have to list more than one: Lonely China Day, Ajinai, Shanren, PK-14 and our buddies Not There.How did you find people who like this genre of music in Beijing?Yusi: We don't have to go find them, they'll find us.Peter: Much to our surprise, they found us.Randy: Yeah, who the hell are those people anyhow?Josh: Yusi and Peter are right: They seem to find us. I guess a lot of Westerners living in China have pent-up nostalgia for home, and our music gives expression to that. As for our Chinese audience, I think it is pure curiosity that draws them in.Parker: Chris Boehner (of The Redbucks) did a great thing by starting the alternating-Tuesdays acoustic music nights at The Great Leap Brewery, which has coalesced this community and spawned tentacles that reach around the city, country, and even the world.DETAILSWhat: The Randy Abel Stable at Halloween Comes EarlyWhere: Yugong YishanWhen: Oct 28, 9pmTel: 6404-2711
