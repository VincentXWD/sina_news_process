Let it be known than Halloween -- arguably the coolest holiday of the year that's not yet a federal holiday -- is right around the corner. Granted, many of you have probably already assembled costumes and absurd lawn decorations, or perhaps built a small fort out of fun sized candy bars. But if you're still seeking a little bit of Halloween spirit, we've assembled this list of 10 iOS apps that'll fit the mood, whether they deliver scares, silly noises, or simply holiday-appropriate distractions. And with most of them free or priced at about a buck, you may have some spare cash left for backup candy reserves. Don't want to tick off those trick-or-treaters, after all.(Agencies)
