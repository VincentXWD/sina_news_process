Anna Wintour thinks fashion should be more fun.The US Vogue editor is currently in the UK for London Fashion Week and has been impressed with the collections she has seen because British designers clearly have a sense of humour when creating clothes, unlike their US counterparts.She said: "I think that's what's so great about British fashion, they always have a sense of humour and that's something we could afford to have a little bit more of here in the States."Anna is also taken with British high street store Topshop because it creates fashionable clothes at affordable prices.She said: "Topshop fills a very special position in British fashion. It provides very inexpensive, well-priced clothes for young girls in very much a street culture. It's something we don't sadly see so much in the US."As well as taking in a number of fashion shows, Anna also helped unveil 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty', the exhibition to be held at New York's Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, which will be launched at this year's Met Ball on May 2.The designer took his own life last February and the fashion industry is now paying him the ultimate tribute.Speaking about Alexander - real name Lee - Anna has said: "There's a lot of very commercial runway approaches: What was so exciting about going to a McQueen show was that you never knew what you were going to see. That sense of theatre and brilliance is something that will influence young designers all over the world for many generations to come."The exhibition, drawn mostly from his archives, will feature about 100 examples of his designs.
