As LFW came to a close, there were so many different styles witnessed by designers, buyers and spectators of the week’s fashion shows.  One of the attendees was US Vogue magazine editor, Anna Wintour who was very appreciative of the quality outfits that stood out.Her response soon followed after she spotted a model wearing a crafted black crow on her head during UK fashion designer, Pam Hogg’s, catwalk show.  “I think that’s what’s so great about British fashion, they always have a sense of humour,” said Wintour.With a comment like that, it seems this celeb won’t be forgetting about British designers any time soon.  She was really taken in by the unlimited use of imagination.  She also commented on Topshop’s catwalk theme of 101 Dalmatians where each model wore a creative design with an added touch of black and white spots.So this proves that LFW is reaching new heights this year with even more creativity being used by aspiring and discovered designers.  Wintour continued: “Topshop fills a very special position in Britain fashion.  It provides very inexpensive, well-priced clothes for young girls in very much a street culture.  It’s something we don’t sadly see so much in the US.”I think it’s safe to say, we have a fan of our British fashion in Miss Anna Wintour!
