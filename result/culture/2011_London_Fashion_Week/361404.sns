Our Sugar sisters in the UK got to speak to Olivia Palermo at London Fashion Week about her collaboration with Mango, what she was wearing and of course, about beauty. Although she was hesitant to reveal anything too juicy (this is the second time she's told us that she keeps her product faves on the DL . . . boo), she did reveal that she loves the sites (naturally) and that she does all of her own hair and makeup to keep her look fresh. Not just a pretty face then. Talking about going from day to night she said, "I add a little bit of liner and deepen my shadow." And as for that gorgeous pout of hers . . . genetics can take credit. She says "I actually don't wear anything on my lips. I really like the shade of my lips and can't seem to find a shade I like better, so I usually just go bare!" Why not. Do you like Ms. P's polished look?
