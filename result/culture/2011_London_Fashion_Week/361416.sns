Who: Peter PillottoWhat: Twisting and draping, tough tailoring and graphic prints.Thoughts: A tougher and sharper take on their sporty looks from last season, Christopher De Vos and Peter Pilotto unveiled a new angle for their autumn/winter 2011 collection. In a striking pallette of black, white, red, yellow and blue, the floor-length dresses and sleek seperates had a harder edge. The duo provided an elegant mix of the clever twisting and draping they’ve become known for on maxi dresses, which were then sharply opposed by the tough tailoring and military coats that came on top. With most of the hems hitting the floor, the collection showed these anti-mini lengths have certainly got some staying power, but peep-hole gaps and splits add an exciting element, whilst the chain print checks and stark colour pallette tied all the looks together.Making a wool cardigan seem like a fresh, original piece takes some doing, but Peter Pilotto pulled it off with these punky wearable designs – refinement and evolution.
