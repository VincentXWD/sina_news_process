London Fashion Week AW11: Temperley London

Who: Temperley LondonWhat: Luxe fabrics, formal gowns and grown-up glamourThoughts: After two years in New York, Temperley returned to London with a bang. Set in the British Museum, the collection was a large leap away from the boho styles that she was originally famed for, instead showing a selection of romantic dresses and gowns influenced by the prim girliness of the Victorian era but still remaining sexy and exuberant with sheer panels and embroided lace. On a muted pallette of blush and monochrome with the occassional dash of red, her dramatic designs are set on luxe fabrics for autumn/winter 2011 showing a maturity and progression into lady-like glamour, but Temperleyâ€™s impeccable attention to detail is still evident in the scattered glitter and tulle frills.
