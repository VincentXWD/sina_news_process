Who: AshishWhat: Scottish punks, tartan, safety pins and sequinsThoughts: Reading Ashish’s show notes is almost as fun as watching his autumn/winter 2011 show.A trip through the Scottish highlands via British punk and pot holes, the London-based India-born designer brought London Fashion Week’s womenswear collections to a sensationally-sparkling close with his playful and patriotic offering for autumn.Dresses – some falling to the knee but mini for the most part – came colourful and shining, with a patchwork of yellow, red, blue, green and purple sequins sewed into tartan prints.
