Organised by the British Fashion Council (BFC) for the London Development Agency with help from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, it first took place in 1984 and currently ranks alongside New York, Paris and Milan as one of the 'Big Four' fashion weeks. It presents itself to funders as a trade event that also attracts significant press attention and benefit to taxpayers. It states that it is attended by over 5,000 press and buyers, and has estimated orders of £40m or £100m. A retail-focused event, London Fashion Weekend, takes place immediately afterwards at the same venue and is open to the general public.The current venue for most of the "on-schedule" events is Somerset House in central London, where a large marquee in the central courtyard hosts a series of catwalk shows by top designers and fashion houses, while an exhibition, housed within Somerset House itself, shows over 150 designers. However, many "off-schedule" events, such as On|Off and Vauxhall Fashion Scout, are organised by other public-funded groups and take place at other venues in central London.London Fashion Week now has a live video stream for viewers to watch Fashion Week from the comfort of there home. The Video stream can be seen on London Fashion Week's Website & on www.celebritystyleinsider.com.[edit]ControversyThe Model Health Enquiry, backed by London Assembly members and the Mayor's threat to withdraw funding, recommended vetting of models.In spring 2010, London Fashion Week became the first major fashion week to fully embrace digital media when it offered all designers who were showing their collections on the catwalk at Somerset House the opportunity to broadcast their shows live on the Internet.
