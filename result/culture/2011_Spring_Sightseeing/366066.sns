SUVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Fiji is working harder to attract more tourists from China, saying as a year-round holiday destination, the country holds value for the Chinese tourism market, local media reported Saturday.Fiji's Ambassador to China Esala Teleni made the remarks while speaking to over 100 travel professionals attending a Tourism Fiji workshop.Teleni was quoted as saying that the key to everything is the ease with which Chinese travelers can now reach Fiji thanks to the thrice-weekly Air Pacific Hong Kong to Nadi direct services, which has had a significant impact on Chinese visitor arrivals since its inception in 2009.He also underlined the efforts undertaken by the Fijian government in supporting the tourism sector.According to Tourism Fiji CEO Josefa Tuamoto, the workshop is designed to educate and update the Chinese travel industry with the latest Fiji travel packages for 2011.While the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries are growing rapidly, China has become Fiji's fastest growing emerging tourism market.
