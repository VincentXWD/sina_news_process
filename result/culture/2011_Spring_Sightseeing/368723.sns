The Shanghai Railway Bureau expects to transport 5.35 million passengers during the Labor Day holiday, nearly 11 percent more people than last year.Rail travel is predicted to peak on April 30, the first day of the three-day holiday (April 30 to May 2),  with railway authorities preparing to handle 1.4 million passengers departing the city for nearby cities, according to Tao Liping, a press officer for the city's railway bureau.He said that the bureau will put 32 extra trains into operation to meet demand, the bulk of which is expected to come from passengers traveling to Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.The city's two major long-distance bus operators, Shanghai Central Long-distance Bus Station and Shanghai South Long-Distance Bus Station, are also bracing for larger crowds this year, predicting to move more than 367,000 passengers during the holiday, up roughly 5 percent from last year.Local transport authorities said Wednesday that the city may see its largest volume of holiday travelers yet this year, during the long weekend, given the warm weather and the attraction of the China Pavilion.The China Pavilion reached its maximum daily capacity of 50,000 people during the  long weekend earlier this month for Tomb-sweeping Festival.
