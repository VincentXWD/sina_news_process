The Mount Kailash, the highest peak in the Gangdise Mountains with an altitude of 6,656 meters, and Mansarova Lake, which lies about 20 kilometers southeast of Mt. Kailash, are considered sacred places by four religions: Tibetan Buddhists, Bonpos, Hindus and Jains. The altitude of the lake is about 4,588 meters, making it one of the highest fresh water lakes in the world. It is said one trip around the sacred mountain, about 52 kilometers to take three days to complete, will wipe away all the sins of one's current lifetime.
