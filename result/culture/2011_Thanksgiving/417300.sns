WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- As the United States begins Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, about 42.5 million Americans will take to the road, traveling at least 80 kilometers for the weekend, up from previous two years, giving the sluggish economy a small boost.Statistics from the American Automobile Association (AAA) indicated that the number is the highest since the start of financial crisis and ensuing recession. With the cost of travel about 20 percent higher since the recession began, the economy is surely to receive the much needed boost.According to AAA, drivers will pay almost 20 percent more for gas compared with two year ago. The cost of air travel is also up by 20 percent, with an average 212 dollars for round-trip airfare for the top 40 domestic routes.Estimates showed that about 90 percent of the travelers are expected to travel by car. But some road conditions in certain parts of the country may give travelers some headache.In east U.S., travel on a 64-kilometer stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was affected by a leaky tanker truck which spilled tar-like liquid driveway sealant Tuesday night. The gooey black musk disabled about 150 cars and damaged an unknown number of other vehicles. Traffic on that section of the road was slowed after the spill.Rainy weather also caused problems for air travelers, with airports in New Jersey and Philadelphia reporting delays.
