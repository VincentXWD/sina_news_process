A statue of a swan girl emerges from a snow pile in Sun Island of Harbin, capital city of Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, Dec 12, 2011. The statue is 27 meters tall with a wingspan of 24 meters, and will be the biggest snow sculpture in the world when it’s finished. The statue, along with two others, will compose a snow sculpture complex of 126 meters by 27 meters, which will be the main sculpture of the upcoming 24th Sun Island International Snow Sculptures Art Exposition in Harbin, starting Dec 20.
