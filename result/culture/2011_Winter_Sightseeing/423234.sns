Located in downtown Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, Pingjiang Street is a historical road along the river, where the city's history and unique feature have been well-preserved. As early as in Song Dynasty, the street had already existed, which was shown on Suzhou's earliest map "Pingjiang Map" as one of the main streets of the town during that time. With the total length of 1,606 meters, the street parallels with Pingjiang River. The typical houses of ancient Suzhou with white walls and black tiles are standing by the street and river, simple and unsophisticated. For many centuries, the street has become a center of much of Suzhou's cultural life.
