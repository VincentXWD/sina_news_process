BEIJING,Dec. 16 (Xinhuanet) – An ice skating rink opened for Christmas on the first level of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Thursday. A 200-square meter rink was set up for the holidays, 57 meters up the iconic Parisian monument.Last year, the ice rink featured a colorful light show. But this year, there’s a more low-key design, with a white mini Eiffel tower replica in the center of the rink. The rink is open daily from 10:30 a.m. until 10:30 p.m. And when visitors are finished skating, they can warm up with a glass of mulled wine or a cup of hot chocolate from the rink-side bar. Admission is free to the tower’s visitors.The Eiffel tower ice rink will close on January 31st next year.(Source: CNTV)
