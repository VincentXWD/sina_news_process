The World AIDS Day falls on Dec. 1, with the theme of "Getting to Zero" this year. UNAIDS is striving to achieve the vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. But activists say this might be a difficult target to accomplish, as discrimination is still widespread in many parts of the world. NGOs and volunteers play a significant role in the AIDS prevention field worldwide. They make their efforts in different way to help the people suffering the disease, to take care of the children who are orphaned by AIDS, to broadcast the knowledge about AIDS prevention and the faith to eliminate discrimination.
