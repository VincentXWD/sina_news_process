JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- "You must learn. Going to school," said Bonginkosi Mthembu, an activist with Prevention and Treatment Literacy Coordinator with Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) , in an interview with Xinhua before the World AIDS Day set on Dec 1st.Mthembu said education is for all "those who are positive and those negative", and encouraged youth who are losing hope to peruse education because they are positive.TAC is a leading South Africa HIV/AIDS advocacy group."People must not stop perusing education because they are HIV positive," Mthembu who hold several academic qualifications on health promotion said on Sunday to Xinhua."It (HIV) is manageable so this must not stop anyone to advance life. They (youth who are positive) need to go to school because there is still life after you are diagnosed HIV positive," said Mthembu, who believe education is "more powerful than HIV/AIDS".Mthembu, also HIV positive, asked for more education and support in rural areas.He said in South Africa cities, Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are now easily accessible because the government rolled the drug out in local clinic and hospital. But mammoth challenge is still in rural communities.Indicating that people in some very remote rural areas don't know how to "take their ARVs and don't even know about ARVs at all", the HIV/AIDS activist called on for more education awareness in rural places on HIV/AIDS and ARVs."What they know is that if you have HIV/AIDS you will die soonest. This perspective must be eradicated," Mthembu said, calling on the Non Governmental (NGOs) sector to be active in rural areas."In cities ARV access is better, more must be done in rural areas to bring ARVs close to people. They (rural people) still have to travel very long distance to get ARVs and this must be challenged for a change," Mthembu told Xinhua.He said Pretoria needs to focus more to rural communities and "make it a point that mobile clinics are easily accessible".The 29 year old father urged NGOs to cooperate with government to take the services down to the remote communities. "NGOs need to join hands and advocate for rural community to they have access to treatment," he said."I can not say the government is not doing enough or is doing enough, rather let me say the battle must continue," he said, "There is still a long way to go in fight HIV/AIDS in South Africa".Mthembu, who is living with his partner who is also HIV positive, called on other people living HIV positive to exercise "regular" to boast the immune system. He said one must "make sure do exercise on regular basis"."At times instead of taking a local taxi to work, I prefer a walk. Instead of walking I jog and at times instead of jogging I run," he told Xinhua."It's easy to exercise," Mthembu said, "When you are home instead of seating calling your children to give you this and that you must do it for yourself..thus part of exercising".The HIV/AIDS activist urged the business community to fund HIV/ AIDS programmes and increase investments in health sector especially in rural communities.
