GENEVA, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- The world has made remarkable progress in HIV infection prevention in 2011 despite the financial crisis, and might be able to see a new generation free of the deadly virus by 2015, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe told Xinhua in a recent interview.Calling 2011 a game changing year for HIV treatment, Sidibe said the world had moved one step closer this year towards the "Three Zeros" target: Zero new HIV infections, Zero discrimination and Zero AIDS-related deaths.An UN declaration adopted by Member States of the General Assembly in June sets new targets to defeat AIDS, including to halve sexual transmission of HIV by 2015, and to ensure that by that year no child will be born with HIV.TREATMENT COVERING HALF IN NEEDDespite the escalating financial crisis, many countries have managed to stablize the HIV epidemic, while more countries are putting more people on treatment and are seeing a declining number of mortality from the disease, Sidibe said.It is "amazing because of the world would expect us to tell them with the flattening of resources, with reduction of resources even from some key donors, that we will have less result," the UNAIDS chief said."(Now) we have 50 percent of people in need of treatment who were on treatment," Sidibe said, noting that only few years ago, treatment only covered less than 10 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS.According to UNAIDS and WHO estimations, of the 14.2 million people eligible for treatment in low- and middle-income countries, about 6.6 million were accessing lifesaving antiretroviral therapy in 2010.Treatment has proved vital not only in averting death of the infected people, but also in preventing new infections. According to Sidibe, if people are put on treatment early, the chance for new infection can be reduced by 96 percent.The achievements have made the UNAIDS chief even more optimistic over the future outlook."I think by 2015, we will have a new generation free of HIV," he said, "We will see that in Botswana, in Namibia, in South Africa, it is amazing what it is happening, in Rwanda soon. So it is something which is encouraging."FINANCIAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKBut to live up to these ambitious goals, the world still faces tough challenges ahead.According to Sidibe, many countries are now facing not only a global financial crisis, but also a public finance crisis."We can not continue to believe that we will have the same approach in terms of investing resources and have similar result," Sidibe said."We need to become smarter, and so making the resources, allocating resources on areas where we will have maximum of return and also doing better," he added, giving the explanation that in the future resource allocation would be based on shared responsibility instead of simply looked at "somewhere is resource and somewhere is disease.""If we want to reach 100 percent of people who are in need of treatment, we need to change completely our way to do business. And that's why the Financial Strategic Framework is critical," Sidibe said.According to UNAIDS's plan, the Framework will based on six essential programme activities: focused interventions for key populations at higher risk; prevention of new HIV infections in children; behaviour change programmes; condom promotion and distribution; treatment, care and support for people living with HIV; and voluntary medical male circumcision in countries with high HIV prevalence."We will start to talk about the beginning of the end of this epidemic," said Sidibe.EMGERING PROBLEMSDespite the generally positive developments in HIV/AIDS control, the epidemic is still spreading fast in some parts of the world.Recent reports from UNAIDS shows that since 2001 East European countries and Central Asian countries have witnessed a 250-percent increase in the number of new infections.Drug injection is a major cause for the surging of new infections in these regions."They (victims) are not reached by services, and they are underground," Sidibe explained. "So when they are underground, they will continue to be victims of transmission," he said.But Sidibe is confident over the future of the two regions."We have one positive news, Russia government just in last October took a decision under Presidential level and also Minister of Foreign Affairs levels to really talk about seriously what should be the next approach to deal with this epidemic," Sidibe said."And I hope that will help us to start seeing new policies which are in line with science," he said."THREE ZEROS"The "Three Zeros" target is at the core of UNAIDS' global drive in HIV/AIDS control.Sidibe praised China's strong commitments to achieve the goal. "China is the first country who adopted the "Three Zeros," he said.In his opinion, "Three Zeros" is not just a magic number. It is about social justice and equal distribution of opportunity which will lead to a shift of attention from disease to people."We will see series of movement in the world today, where people, civil society movement and others are calling for "Three Zeros," Sidibe said, giving an example that the Britain also introduced its prevention programme under the name of "Zero New Infection," while Kenya even set the first HIV equity tribunal in Africa to give access to justice to HIV affected people."That is social transformation due to AIDS, but that is also what I will call a society which will start talking about installing dignity of people," Sidibe said.For Sidibe, one important message for the International AIDS Day, which falls on December 1, is to continue the global solidarity in fighting AIDS and "not forget about the people, life of families and communities largely affected by this epidemic."
