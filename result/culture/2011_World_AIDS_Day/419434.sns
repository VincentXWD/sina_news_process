KIEV, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- A flash mob, stylized as a football match, was organized Thursday to mark World AIDS day.The ceremony of the football-styled flash mob was not chosen by chance as 11 people, equivalent to the number of a football team, die of AIDS in Ukraine every day.On the football pitch, one team represented the human body while the other the virus. Unfortunately, the "virus team" beat the "body team."According to non-government organizations, an estimated 300,000 people infected by HIV live in Ukraine with an addition of 60 new infections every day.The Ukrainian government plans to earmark 40 million U.S. dollars in its draft state budget for 2012 to finance a program to combat HIV and AIDS.
