KHARTOUM, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese and international institutions on Thursday said Sudan was categorized among countries of concentrated AIDS epidemic and that 90,000 people in Sudan are living with HIV."Sudan is a concentrated AIDS epidemic country," said Dr. Ehab Ali Hassan, Director of Sudan National AIDS Programme (SNAP), an affiliate of Sudanese Ministry of Health, at a press conference in Khartoum Thursday on occasion of World AIDS Day."This means the epidemic is spreading among the more vulnerable categories to the disease, which is youths," he said, adding that "the disease control efforts focus on managing the epidemic within this category so that it will not spread among other categories."He attributed the increasing infection cases to the fact that Sudan lies within the AIDS belt in Africa, saying "there are areas in Sudan witnessing displacement and conflicts which are factors that help in the spreading of AIDS."Nils Kastberg, UNICEF Representative and Representative of the UN Agencies operating in the field of AIDS control in Sudan, said that "we have 90,000 people in Sudan living with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) ... but the problem is that it is increasing and there are two things that are making it grow -- one is the lack of knowledge and the other is silence. Nobody is talking about it."Concerned with children born with the virus from their mothers, Kastberg said the HIV test was made for around 28,000 pregnant women out of over a million this year.The SNAP provides HIV tests, consoling, treatment and care at many government hospitals. In 2007, the SNAP in cooperation with the UNICEF launched a successful program to prevent transmission of the disease from the mother to the infant.However, many challenges slow down the authorities' campaign of AIDS control, including discrimination against the carriers of the virus, as well as social traditions that discourage reviewing sensitive issues relating to ways of HIV transmission or means of prevention against it.Additionally, the lack of data in all parts of Sudan is a great barrier for national and international organizations in the field of AIDS control.The most recent field survey, conducted in 2002, indicated that the infection rate in Sudan reached 16 percent, but the figure is likely to change after separation with South Sudan.In this respect, the SNAP director explained that results of a comprehensive survey would come out by the end of December, which is likely to provide accurate data on the spread of the disease and the most infected areas in the country.He noted that the coming period would witness major interventions, including provision of care for the people living with HIV. He disclosed that a project would be launched later to employ 1000 people living with HIV.He further declared the completion of a draft law for those living with HIV and that it was at the final stages for approval, saying that more than 138 centers for free HIV tests have been established.Nils Kastberg, meanwhile, said Sudan was among the first Arab countries to respond to AIDS control, saying that there was need for further efforts in this respect.He added that Sudan's geographical location, its sharing of borders with several African countries, the population movements and displacement due to armed conflicts were additional factors for the spread of the disease.
