GENEVA, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Thursday applauded a decision made by the Chinese leadership to fill its HIV resource gap by increasing domestic investments.During a discussion with a group of people representing HIV carriers and AIDS patients, doctors and AIDS researcher, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao pledged new measures to help people living with HIV/AIDS obtain affordable drug treatment, enjoy fair job and education chances and avoid being discriminated.In a press communique, UNAIDS said the "new commitment from China came at a crucial moment," as resources for AIDS are declining and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is facing a major setback in resource mobilization.In addition, UNAIDS commended China for scaling up its AIDS resources in a short time span, including its evidence-informed HIV prevention services."By rapidly scaling up access to drug substitution therapies, it has reduced new HIV infections among people using these services to close to zero," UNAIDS said, adding that China had also made important advances in its anti-discrimination programs and support for civil society organizations.
