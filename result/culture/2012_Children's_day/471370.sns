A childhood in trash dump

June 1, only a few days away, is the International Children’s Day, a day when children under the age of 14 can enjoy one day off in China. It’s a day to expect for many children in China because Children’s Day often means new clothes and new toys. For children featured in Netease’s new visual report “A Childhood in Trash Dump”, it’s probably also a day to expect because they may find used toys dumped by those who got new ones.
