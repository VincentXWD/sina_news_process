Hilton Beijing WangfujingIn this weekly bilingual class, the Hilton’s cooking maestros have your children cooking up classic dishes from chocolate specials to fish rissoles. Children as young as four can join the fun: the ingredients are all carefully chopped up and prepared beforehand, so all the kids have to do is get stuck in. They’ll look the part too, as they are provided with aprons and a chef’s hat, which they can take away as a souvenir. Parents can chill with coffees on nearby tables and proudly watch their little chefs at work in the open kitchen. After the two hours are up, kids can take away their culinary creations for mum and dad to enjoy at home.Vasco’sTo book, contact Jason Chen on 5812 8888 ext 8411, 138 1072 0018 or jason.chen@hilton.com.

Dishes are fun and easy to make, ranging from potato and cheese-stuffed dumplings to yummy pizzas. Sitting on stools in the spacious kitchen area, youngsters are able to see and handle all the ingredients easily. The teacher is full of enthusiasm and skilful; kids can watch nimble fingers at work before trying to recreate dishes themselves. Creativity is the flavour of the day as students are encouraged to be unique in their ideas, and an ayi ensures that making a mess doesn’t get out of hand. Although children are perfectly fine cooking up a storm on their own, parents are welcome to join.Classes arranged at times to suit private clients. Classes from 150RMB.China Culture CenterThis is one for all the family. Classes are in Chinese but there’s a translator on hand and the ingredients are supplied, so all you need to add to the equation is an enthusiastic child willing to get their hands dirty. All lessons start off with a presentation by the chef before the students get stuck in. The hand-pulled noodles class, one of the most popular, is sure to get kids active as they have fun stretching lumps of dough into those thin starchy strips we all love. Another popular class involves making longevity peach buns, a culinary symbol of long life. Children dye their buns pink and have fun with the sticky lotus paste. Lasting around two hours, there are a range of classes on offer here, so make sure you check the calendar on the organisation’s website.Call or check online for schedule.
