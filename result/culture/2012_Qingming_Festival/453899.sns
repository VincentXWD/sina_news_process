Piglet-shaped bread gains popularity in Guangzhou, Guangdong province with the upcoming Tomb Sweeping Day.As a tradition, Cantonese sacrifice roast suckling pigs to their ancestors on the day.Higher material costs have driven up prices of roast suckling pigs by 20 percent to more than 500 yuan ($79.45) in Guangzhou this year, making the 30 yuan piglet-shaped bread a cheaper alternative, according to Guangzhou Daily.The Tomb Sweeping Day this year falls on April 4.
