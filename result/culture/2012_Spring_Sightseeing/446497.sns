Spring means reverberation for most of China's tourism destinations such as Nyingchi Prefecture in southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region. As the numerous peach trees scattered across the prefecture come into bloom, the local government is busy preparing for the annual peach blossom tourism festival on March 15.Nyingchi is often compared to southern Chinese cities for its mild climate and gentle picturesque scenery. With an average altitude of 3,100 meters and surrounded by the snow-capped Himalaya mountain range, the region welcomes spring earlier than the rest of Tibet.After the local airport began operations in 2006, Nyingchi became the second most popular travel destination in Tibet behind Lhasa. Every year between March and April, the prefecture enjoys a tourism boom because of its peach blossoms. To celebrate the tenth birthday of the peach blossom festival, this year's event features a photography contest and the selection of a goodwill ambassador.Â
