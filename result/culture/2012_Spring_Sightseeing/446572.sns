Heilongtan Park, otherwise known as the Black Dragon Pond Park, is located at the foot of a snow capped mountain in the tourism town of Lijiang, in southwest China's Yunnan province. The park is named after a famous folktale about a young male black dragon that is said to have once ruled the weather in the region. A landmark site in the ancient township, the park is a popular destination for local residents and tourists alike.
