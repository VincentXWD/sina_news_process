The 2012 Shanghai Cherry Blossoms Festival has been scheduled in Gucun Park of Baoshan district from March 30 to April 28, one week later than the last year due to the extended cold weather.In 2011, when the festival was first held, more than 700,000 people visited Gucun Park to enjoy the beauty of cherry blossoms - including 100,000 people on the day the flow of visitors peaked.Because of the mass enthusiasm, the park expanded the area that is densely planted with cherry trees an extra 300 mu (0.2 sq km). The total size of the bloom-filled area has reached 500 mu of land.Currently Gucun Park has more than 30 types of cherry, with blossoms in many hues: light red, pink, purple and white. The peak of the blooming period is around April 10."We expected to have a million visitors this year," says Huang Aihua, the deputy manager who responsible for ecological engineering in Baoshan district, "We are fully prepared to welcome 100,000 to 150,000 visitors everyday."Huang says that the number of ticket admission offices will be increased to 30 in order to let visitors quickly enter the park.Because the overflow crowds made short work of the food supply last year, the number of restaurants in the park has been increased this year as well."We are able to offer meals for 50,000 to 60,000 visitors at a time this year," Huang says.The park also has opened up a street of traditional Chinese food sellers in the central part of the cherry blossoms areas, offering food such as steamed dumplings and fried noodles.Meanwhile, five themed events will be held during the festival, including a photograph competition and traditional Chinese opera performances.The most attention-getting event is group dating: Hundreds of single women and men will participate to find their partners. It is also a good opportunity for those who want to extended their social networks.In addition to the seasonal allure of cherry blossoms, visitors can also enjoy other attractions such as the forest area, children's playground and barbecue area.A 4-D cinema in the park also will be opened during the festival.Some 4,000 parking spaces are available, mainly around gate 1 and 2.
