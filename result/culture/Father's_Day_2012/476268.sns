One of the best ways you can celebrate the men in your life – especially on Father's Day – is to help them celebrate more special days like birthdays and other milestones with loved ones.Celebrating more birthdays means living longer, something more cancer survivors are doing thanks to advances in treatment and to screening tests that find cancer early, when it’s easiest to treat.Colon CancerMany colon cancers begin as growths called polyps. Not all polyps will progress to cancer, but for those that do the transformation usually takes a number of years. Cancer can be prevented by finding and removing these polyps with colon cancer screening tests. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.Polyp detection and removal is best accomplished by regular screening recommended to start at age 50 for people at average risk for developing colon cancer. However, screening recommendations may be quite different for those with an affected relative. That’s why it’s so important to know your family history. Simply knowing that a relative had cancer is not sufficient; you need to know details:•Where did the cancer start?•How old was the relative when cancer was diagnosed?Diet, weight and exercise also affect your risk for colon cancer. You can help lower your risk by eating more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and less red meat (beef, lamb, or pork) and less processed meat (hot dogs and some luncheon meat). Men should limit alcohol to no more than two drinks a day. You can also help lower your risk for colon cancer by getting more exercise and staying at a healthy weight.Prostate CancerFollowing a period for public comment, the United States Preventive Services Task Force released its final recommendation for prostate cancer screening. The Task Force now recommends against PSA-based screening for all men, regardless of age. Strong evidence shows that PSA screening is associated with significant harms. Nearly 90 percent of men with PSA-detected prostate cancer undergo early treatment with surgery, radiation, or androgen deprivation therapy. Evidence shows that up to five in 1,000 men will die within one month of prostate cancer surgery and between 10 and 70 men will survive, but suffer life-long adverse effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction.Skin CancerDuring your regular checkups, have your doctor check your skin for signs of skin cancer. If you notice any changes to existing moles, tell your doctor right away.
