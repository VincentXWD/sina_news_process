Father's Day: What does dad want?

Turns out it’s not what women want on Mother’s Day (that, gentleman, is universally agreed to be a day off). It’s also not at all what their partners may think they want.That’s the result of an online survey by Ebates, the electronic rebate company.The company commissioned a survey of 2,215 parents nationally and found a disconnect between what women think the men in their lives want as a present this weekend and what those men actually want.Sixty percent of women told researchers their partners would love a ticket to a sporting event, while only 36 percent of the men surveyed cited this as a top choice.The majority of men (52 percent) instead said they’d like a smartphone or tablet. This was followed by a home cooked meal.Meanwhile women were thinking that besides tickets, fathers also wanted power tools. (What? Aren’t they eager to finish the honey-do list?)At least the genders agreed on one thing. A guilt-free weekend with friends ranked low for both givers and receivers.What’s most interested about the results isn’t necessarily the gift choices — the participants were responding to a list of provided options. It was that women ranked those options in pretty much the reverse order of how the men ranked them.Why the miscommunication?I would never go so far as to suggest that fathers tend to be less communicative (though, this happens to be my second post on the subject of gender miscommunication today). I am partial to this view, however, because it happens to be the case in a family I know pretty well.Here’s a good point for full disclosure: When I asked my husband what he wanted for Father’s Day, he answered, “Nothing. Don’t worry about it.”This was before I read this survey so, naturally, I proceeded to buy him a family four-pack to a Nationals game.Are you on the giving or receiving end of a Father’s Day gift? What are your top gift choices?
