The week leading up to Father's Day is National Men's Health Week. Whether or not a man is a father, this week is a great time for men to take stock of their health and talk about important health topics with their healthcare providers, or to find a provider if they do not have one.Men everywhere take time to take care of things. They take care of their cars. They take care of their homes. They take care of assignments at work. But how often do men take some time to take care of themselves? Men can take daily steps to safer, healthier lives and protect themselves from disease and injury.Get Enough SleepInsufficient sleep is tied to many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and depression. Being tired also increases the risk for injuries from motor vehicle and machinery-related accidents. There is no “magic number” for the amount of sleep you need, but in general adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night.Be Smoke-FreeAvoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Quitting smoking has immediate and long-term benefits for yourself and everyone around you. If you're a smoker and want to quit, call Carson City Health's Cessation Counselor Cindy Hannah at 887-2190 to learn about ways you can stop using tobacco.Be Physically Active and Eat a Healthy DietGet moving! Include activities that raise your breathing and heart rate and that strengthen your muscles. Find an activity that you like, and aim for 2.5 hours per week. Fuel your activity by eating a variety of healthy foods every day. Limit foods and drinks high in calories, sugar, salt, fat and alcohol.Get a Check-UpJust because you may feel fine doesn't mean you don't need your annual checkup. Certain diseases and conditions may not have symptoms, so checkups help diagnose issues early or before they can become a problem. See your doctor or nurse for regular checkups. Also, get to the doctor as soon as possible if you have any symptoms that are out of theordinary.Know and Understand Your Health NumbersNumbers like blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and body mass index can provide a glimpse of your health status and risk for certain diseases, so it's important to know what they mean. Keep an eye on these numbers, and check with your doctor if something isn't right. Even if you haven't previously had health problems, get checked occasionally to make sure you're on the right track.Good health improves your physical and mental performance in sports and work, increases your stamina, and helps you to lead a longer, fuller life. Take steps to tune up your health today.
