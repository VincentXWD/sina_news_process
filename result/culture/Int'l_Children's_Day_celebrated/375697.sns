May 15, 1948 is the day of the creation of Israel, but of "Nakba" (catastrophe) for Palestinians who were displaced ever since and have lived in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Children who were born in the refugee camps suffer both physically and psychologically during their miserable childhood.
