As we draw closer to Christmas 2011 it’s time to  start planning.   Christmas preparations in advance can make your  Christmas fairly stress free.  I always purchase an exercise book in  September and start my plan.In one section I write a list of names for those I purchase gifts  for. I then write suggestions of what I might purchase for them (I find  this much easier as looking for gifts are far more focused).  I have  researched the internet and have made a list of Christmas 2011 top 10  gifts to make your choices so much easier.  As I purchase the gifts I  cross them off and if you have already purchased your gift wrapping wrap  the present store it.Next in another section of the book I write the menu for Christmas  Day and then a list of what will need to be purchased for the menus and  any special menus over the holiday period in categories1: Dry goods including cans, pretzels, drinks etc.2: Frozen goods3: Fresh goods that can only be purchased at last minute
