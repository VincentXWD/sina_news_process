BEIJING - Beijing's fourteen subway lines will extend operating hours by 30 minutes on December 23 and 24, which will help ease the predicted gridlock, said traffic authorities Friday. Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport said congestion on those days will double travel time. The commission predicted the rush to start from 3 pm to around 8:30 pm, with some downtown areas until 11:00 pm.
