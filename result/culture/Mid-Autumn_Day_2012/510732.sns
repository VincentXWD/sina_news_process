BEIJING, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- About 11 million vehicles are expected to hit Beijing's expressways during the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays, marking a year-on-year increase of 20 percent, according to the capital's transport authorities.The increase is mainly a result of the new toll-free policy for passenger cars during major holidays initiated by the government in August, an official with the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport said.The move is widely expected to fuel tourism consumption. Since the policy was announced, there have been reports that car rental agencies have seen a surge in business amid the approaching holidays.Good weather has been forecast for the two holidays running from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7, another factor contributing to the expected increase, the official said.Meanwhile, the city's trunk highways will see 1.7 million vehicles during the holidays, an increase of 10 percent from last year, said the official.Beijing transport authorities have started a road safety check-up to spot hidden troubles that may lead to accidents.An around-the-clock road information service will be available during the holidays, integrating phone hotlines, the Internet and broadcast media.The Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 30 this year, is a traditional festival observed as an occasion for family reunions on the 15th day of the eighth month on the lunar calendar.The National Day falls on Oct. 1, and its seven-day holiday period, dubbed the Golden Week, is a peak tourism season across the country.
