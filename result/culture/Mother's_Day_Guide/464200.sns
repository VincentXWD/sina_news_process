 She birthed you, raised you and tried to tell you that crimped bangs were a bad idea. Mom is the most important woman in your life. So this Mother’s Day, treat her to a celebration, just the two of you, without breaking the bank. Here are some heartfelt and affordable ways to honor the one you call Mom.At-Home YogaIf your mom is always running around, going to that meeting and making this appointment, get her to slow down with a private yoga lesson. Not only will it soothe her mind and body, but also, you two can bond during downward dog.Gourmet BrunchBefore you start getting anxious about finding a last-minute reservation at that four-star restaurant, consider cooking a lovely brunch at home for your mother, like you used to do as a child. OK, minus the runny eggs and burnt toast. Include a menu card and a fresh floral arrangement on the table to make it truly special.Afternoon GardeningHead outside with your green thumbs for the day. Bring plants, tools, nosh and cocktails to get down and dirty while planting with your mom. Every day after, she will smile as she looks out over her new blooms of bougainvillea or English tea roses.Classic Game NightFor a great group activity, invite family over for a night of backgammon, Scrabble, chess and Yatzee. Mom will love having the house full of laughter and trash-talking again.Help Around The HouseDedicate the day to helping Mom with all the items on her at-home to-do list. Whether you’re changing the printer’s ink cartridge, cleaning out the garage or taking old clothes to Goodwill, your mom will be endlessly thankful that you came over to lend a hand and spend quality time.Family TraditionsSpend the day with Mom and learn how to make all those dishes that she cooks so well. Meatloaf, fried chicken, spaghetti… learn all the subtle secrets of pinches and smidgens to cook like the pro.Movie MarathonPop gourmet popcorn and snuggle up on the couch to watch Real Women Have Curves, Spanglish, Because I Said So, American Violet and Eve’s Bayou. The stories about mothers and daughters in these films will bring you and yours closer together.Girls' Spa DayNothing says mother-daughter bonding quite like a day at the spa. Instead of separate massages, enjoy shared activities, like mani-pedis and hair appointments, followed by a great lunch.
