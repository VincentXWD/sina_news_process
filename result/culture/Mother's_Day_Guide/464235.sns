Got big love for Mom, but not a big budget?

You can still make a splash on Mother's Day, as there are scads of sweetly sentimental, gorgeously glimmering and fiercely fashionable gifts to choose from to honor that most special lady in your life.Fashion: Mama DramaShow Mom just how trend-savvy you are by gifting her something from the hip list. (And no, it doesn't have to be spendy to be stylish.) Consider this spring's super-bright fashion fad: Pick a neon-bathed accessory to boldly bowl her over. Smaller and thus more affordable picks include clutch bags, cross-body mini-bags and wristlet wallets in wide-awake shades like tangerine, yellow, sky blue and acid green. If Mom prefers the softer sight of florals, you'll find those designs gathered on cellphone and other tech cases (especially Vera Bradley's), trendy tote bags and eco-wise market bags. Abstract prints and geometric shapes are definitely of the moment, too, so a wispy length of scarf bedecked in one of these energized (and sometimes slightly retro) prints is certain to see lots of shoulder time.Does Mom have a wild streak? Satisfy it with a snake-print flat so she can take a walk on the wild side. Does she love her baubles and beads? Jewelry under $50 can be dazzling: Choose shiny rose-gold vermeil, semi-precious stones, small-scale stud earrings or symbolic mother-of-pearl pieces. Filigree drop earrings are on trend, and those lavish lengths are affordable when crafted in vermeil. Massively popular Pandora charms are budget friendly, as are bargain beauties from Kendra Scott and the luxe-look-for-less line of watches from Style & Co.Family: The Kin CrowdSome of the most meaningful Mother's Day gifts display palpable proof of her place in the family's heart. Birthstone jewelry glimmers with symbolism, and finding affordable pieces of it isn't as tough as you'd think. Skip the solid gold or precious gemstone-encrusted pieces and instead look for sterling silver or vermeil (a thin gold layer over sterling silver or brass), and smaller items like pendants, rings or delicate bracelets. Personalized pieces are always a Mother's Day slam dunk, and stackable rings can easily be engraved with her children's names. If she already owns birthstone or other name-checking jewelry, consider a bauble that simply spells out "Mom" to get your point across. ("Mom" key pendants are a newer twist on this classic choice.)The family fun doesn't stop at the sparkly stuff. Check out photo tote bags, cellphone cases, coasters and other products that can be special ordered to show off her favorite faces. Personalized family tree décor does a great job of gathering the gang together, too, whether it's a literal tree with a tiny frame on each branch capturing a family member, or a larger printed version detailing names and birthdates. Family crests are also a special order that make a supremely special gift.Fun: Hugs and BlissesSome Mother's Day gifts are stylish and some are sentimental, but moms are always looking for a way to destress, relax and unwind. Bring much-needed downtime to her busy life with gifts meant to pamper and please, like cushy-cute spa slippers, footbath massagers, personalized bathrobes and the tempting treasure trove of a spa gift set or basket. Moms needing a boost (and what mom doesn't?) will get it with a smile when sipping morning coffee or afternoon tea from a "Best Mom" mug. Other cool culinary gifts include fondue sets perfect for bringing the family together, wine decanters for after the kiddies have gone to bed, gourmet salt sets for spicing up her creations and all manner of Jonathan Adler housewares to add a little midcentury kitsch to her kitchen.A cookbook is truly a gift that keeps on giving. We suggest tomes on the yummiest new sweet treat crazes: macarons and whoopie pies. (You can also skip the middle woman and order some premade goodies to be delivered directly to Mom.) Liven up her décor with surprisingly affordable accents such as gorgeous crystal votive holders from Orrefors, "mom" figurines in glass or ceramic, Bonsai trees that last far longer than the usual bouquet of flowers or the easiest-care floral gift of all: a dried flower wreath.
