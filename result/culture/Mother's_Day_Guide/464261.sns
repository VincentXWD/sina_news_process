If you're looking to splurge on Mom, we've got a treasure trove of luxe and lovely items that will make this Mother's Day positively unforgettable. From jewelry that dazzles to pampering products that help her relax, we're running the gamut of glam for our favorite lady.Jewelry: Treasure QuestWhat's more precious to Mom than all the gold on earth? Her family, of course, and there's a perfect way to bring these two valuable commodities together: birthstone jewelry. Gift her symbolic treasures crafted from solid gold and genuine gemstones, and they'll last through many generations. (Personal engraving makes it extra special, and companies like Posh Mommy specialize in this familial finery.) For even more of a splurge, look to diamond and white-gold letter necklaces for the most dazzling initial impression. Diamond hoop earrings, more luxe than simple studs, will amaze any mom, while a strand of fine pearls from a master such as Mikimoto is another jewelry gift so well-made she'll be proud to hand it down.Does Mom prefer trendy over traditional? Impress her with breathtaking picks from hot modern jewelry designers such as Alexis Bittar, Marco Bicego, Ippolita and Oscar de la Renta. They all craft with a modern sensibility, without veering into gone-next-season edgy.  Fragrance and Beauty: In Charm's WayEvery mom is beautiful, but some are more into paint and perfume than others. If your mama loves the drama, and you want to show off your beauty bona fides, choose high-end, critically acclaimed cosmetic lines. Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Dior offer gorgeous gifts guaranteed to impress, and Chantecaille's new "The Coral Reefs" palette is a breathtaking example of both product and packaging. In the land of sensational scents, Tom Ford is the current king of luxe, with the array of magical releases from Bond No. 9 New York following close behind. (Younger moms will flip for the trendy Flowerbomb from Viktor & Rolf.)A beautifying phenom for the face, the Clarisonic Skincare Brush will actually save Mom money in the long run if she normally visits an aesthetician or dermatologist, while the HoneyBelle BodyBuffer offers spa-quality results at home for the rest of the bod. For the ultimate in hair styling, the Sedu Icon Prive bills itself as the most advanced hairdryer in the world, while much more affordable Mason Pearson hairbrushes get critical raves for grooming.  Fashion: Once in a StyleThink clothes are the trickiest gift to buy? While you will need Mom's correct size, and it's always a good idea to shop at stores with liberal return policies, there are certain splurge-worthy items that the majority of moms would be thrilled to receive. High-end clothing and accessories can be the ultimate Mother's Day gift. Think: pure cashmere robes from Loro Piana, sleep and loungewear from Natori or one perfect pair of last-forever pumps from famed designers Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin or Prada. Does Mom yearn for a status handbag? Look to Fendi, Chloe, Michael Kors or the Chanel-inspired quilt-rich creations of Marc Jacobs.Smaller accessories (but no less spectacular) will kick Mom's style profile into the stratosphere. A super-glam pair of sunglasses from Tom Ford, Dior or Prada lend her movie-star mystery, especially if they're "cat eyes," this year's hottest shape. Drapey scarves go glam, too, if you choose one from Missoni, Diane von Furstenberg or a mega-vivid length from Emilio Pucci.   For Her Home: Domestic AgendaMom's home is ideally a place of beauty and comfort, so do your domestic duty this Mother's Day with gifts that add to the ambiance, or just plain pamper her. Interior decorating is a cinch with masterfully made accents such as vases from Kosta Boda or Baccarat, sleek wood and silver combos from Nambe or the rustic glam of Michael Aram's silver housewares. Kate Spade picture frames literally surround loved ones, Giraffe at Home throws keep everyone cozy and, if Mom collects candles, very few match the quality of Jo Malone, Diptyque or Dayna Decker. In the home fragrance category, Antica Farmacista wins by more than a nose.Gifting flowers is synonymous with Mother's Day, but if you want to go all-out this year, consider a bouquet of 100 pink roses. The shade symbolizes gratitude, elegance and refinement. Is Mama a java fan? A fancy espresso machine will keep her buzzing. Does she desperately need to unwind? Massage chairs (and less pricey but still soothing massaging chair pads) bring some bliss to her downtime.
