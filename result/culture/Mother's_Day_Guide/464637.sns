Of all the holidays that pressure us to shower loved ones with gifts of adulation, Mother’s Day is the one most worth celebrating.Planning a pleasant brunch on a sun-kissed patio or organizing a fancy dinner is the least one can do to repay Mom for all the care she put into raising her children.Mom’s favorite things“I think brunch to me is what Mother’s Day is all about,” said Cleveland restaurateur and Food Network personality Michael Symon, owner of Lola on E. 4th St., Lolita in Tremont, and B Spot in Woodmere. “An epic brunch. It should be all about your mom.”Symon stressed that details are the most important part of a Mother’s Day brunch.“Make sure you have all those things there that you know your mom loves,” Symon said. “Her favorite things to eat, her favorite things to drink. You should have her favorite flowers on the table. This should be a day that’s not about you at all and completely embraces your mother.”Decision, decisions, decisionsNot everyone can cook a Mother’s Day feast like Symon does for his mom, but there are multiple options when it comes to picking a restaurant at which to celebrate.Brian Lachman, manager at flour restaurant in Moreland Hills, said he anticipates around 400 guests between the restaurant’s Mother’s Day brunch and dinner specials.“Usually with Mother’s Day, it’s a big brunch kind of day,” Lachman said. “It’s going to be more comfort food. The families can sit and relax and appreciate their mothers. And then for dinners, we’re going to have a condensed dinner menu, but we’re going to have some exciting specials.”More people are currently signed up for flour’s brunch option, but Lachman said “a lot of people don’t want to necessarily go to a really fine dining experience” for Mother’s Day.Especially when the restaurant’s most popular brunch special – “Italian eggs Benedict” – is on the menu.People opting for a dining excursion should plan for packed venues, especially in the afternoon.“Mother’s Day is the busiest day of the year for most restaurants,” said Kevin Barthauer, general manager of Abuelo’s Mexican Food Embassy in Warrensville Heights. “It’s a huge day for the industry. You’re going to see long waits. Look for some place that has a buffet or some sort of limited menu. Or adjust your timing. Going a little later in the evening is usually better or going right away in the morning.”Wives are mothers, tooWhile moms take center stage on Mother’s Day, wives can’t be overlooked when it comes to celebrating.“I like to take my wife out,” said Barthauer, who advises getting a babysitter for such an occasion. He said his four sons make going out a challenge.“I plan to take my own advice with this at some point. If I were to come home and say to my wife, ‘Honey, I’ve arranged for us to have a babysitter, and we’re going out to eat,’ that would just make her day, big time.”What about the perfect Mother’s Day treat?“My wife would say, ‘Absolutely give me a margarita,’” said Barthauer, laughing.
