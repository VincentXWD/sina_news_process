As much as I love a pretty handbag or beautiful necklace, I just adore handmade gifts, especially when I know that my kids’ hands were involved.Now while I don’t necessarily have Martha Stewart genes when it comes to crafts, I can follow directions, which is really all you’ll need to be able to do to make these three cool DIY Mother’s Day gift ideas from our gift guide with your kiddos.1. Beaded BraceletsAll you’ll need are beads, thread, and nimble fingers to make these gorgeous bracelets, which just so happen to be super trendy right now. My eight-year old loves doing this with me, and they make a fun gift for a hip mom or grandmom.2. Loop PotholdersThese potholders will take you and your lucky recipient way back in time. Plus, they’re pretty handy in the kitchen. I use the ones my daughter made me all the time.3. Repainted Recycled VaseThese vases (shared with us by Jessica Alba!) are so ridiculously easy you could make a bunch for all your favorite moms and fill them with some fresh flowers. You can find vases at your local thrift store and turn then into masterpieces.
