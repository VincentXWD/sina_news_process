The dining highlight of the week was definitely my visit to the newly opened Brasserie Flo out on Xiaoyun Lu. I always felt like the aging Rainbow Plaza location detracted from Flo’s appeal, but the new spot has the opposite effect and really takes the restaurant to elegant new heights. When you walk in, there’s a dessert counter on one side, and a seafood counter on the other, and I sampled great food from both, with some very tasty oysters and a delicious lemon tart. Service is superb, and I’m really looking forward to the opening of the terrace out front.The big dining event of the weekend is Mother’s Day, and we’ve assembled a massive list of brunches and other promotions here.And some major dining news: Beijing is getting its own branch of Shanghai’s popular Lost Heaven, which soft opens this Saturday in Ch’ienmen 23 (aka The Legation Quarter). It’s an upscale Yunnan restaurant with food from along the Ancient Tea Horse Trail and minority cuisine. The official opening is at the end of the month.June will also see the opening of Q Mex, a Mexican restaurant and bar by Q Bar owner Echo Sun. The food should be upscale, but the ambiance casual, and the kitchen will also stay open late for hungry party-goers. They’re also planning on having one of the most extensive tequila selections in Beijing. Stay tuned for more news.Another upcoming opening is Bar Veloce, a new wine bar opening in 1949. I don’t have any more information about the concept or opening dates but will let you know when I do.
