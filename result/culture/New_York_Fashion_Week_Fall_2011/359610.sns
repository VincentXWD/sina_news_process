NEW YORK, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Rolling out her Fall 2011 Collection on the catwalk at Lincoln Center on Saturday, China-born designer Vivienne Tam dazzled this February's New York Fashion Week goers with a fascinating presentation of Chinese aesthetic charm.With a combination of tweeds, silk, antique jewel-tones and silhouettes inspired by Chinese Kung Opera, her designs mimicked the opera performers' movements and elaborated costumes, as well as the opera houses' endearing quaintness.The collection fabricated a daydream of music, song and dance, which was realized by patterns, dramatic designs and layers."I wanted to give the runway a voice that echoes Chinese Opera past," said New York resident Tam, who was born in Guangzhou and brought up in Hong Kong.The fashion week, held every February and September, embodies New York's status as one of the world's top fashion hubs.
