"I believe Panda Pambassador is the best job in the world at the moment," said Ashley Robertson when she was interviewed by "Good Morning America" of American Broadcasting Company (ABC). What she said has been proved true by her flying in September to Chengdu from the United States, which is only for one purpose, that is, to accompany giant pandas.Ashley Robertson had a passion for giant pandas ever since she was a little girl. She said she spent a lot of time in visiting giant pandas in many zoos in the U.S., and she loved them so much that she even named her dog "panda". Ashley Robertson took part with 11 other finalists in the final of a global competition held in Chengdu Sept. 29, 2010 to serve as a "Pambassador". Finally she conquered the judges and netizens with her patience, skilled experience, and especially her love for Chengdu, where giant pandas inhabit. She became one of the six Pambassadors. Ashley Robertson's first job as a Pambassadors is to look after a panda named Qiqi for one month in the Chengdu Panda Base. Qiqi was one year old and was so named because its birth weight was only 77 grams, a number which has the similar accent as "qiqi" in Chinese. Everyday during the month, Ashley Robertson is required to clean Qiqi's enclosure, prepare bamboo, and observe and record her behaviors under the instruction of panda experts in the base. Having done these must-do jobs, she could take Qiqi to the garden and enjoy leisure time, during which they chased each other, dabbled in water and took photos of Qiqi. "Nothing can make people happier than playing with Qiqi", said Ashley Robertson. "This is a fantastic job, I really want to go on with it forever. I hope I can stay here as a volunteer in the future."
