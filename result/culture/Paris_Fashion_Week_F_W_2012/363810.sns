After Paris Fashion Week, designers look ahead

LET us briefly recap the Paris Fashion Week that was.On Tuesday, March 1, the house of Dior dismissed the designer John Galliano over allegations that he made drunken anti-Semitic remarks. On Thursday, Christophe Decarnin missed his own Balmain show for reasons the company will not comment upon (though Women’s Wear Daily described the cause as an “apparent breakdown”). And there were approximately a zillion rumors about other designers, including one that Chloéhad not renewed Hannah MacGibbon’s contract.And some clothes were shown.“It was an exciting season,” said Ronald Frasch, the president and chief merchandising officer of Saks Fifth Avenue. “The use of outerwear and eco-furs has been fantastic, and I loved Chanel.”But fashion has been overwhelmed by news this season, and now an entire industry is taking more seriously the impact of business pressures on the creative mind-set, and not only that of designers. Mr. Frasch said that Saks executives had met this week to encourage a discussion with employees about managing the stresses they face. “We have to be observant and quickly intervene if we see behavior that isn’t normal,” he said.A lot of attention has been focused this week on the multiplying number of collections produced each year to feed an ever more demanding editorial and consumer appetite. Suggesting that this could have played a role in recent events requires a fairly big presumption — that designers, by nature, are delicate flowers. It is an interesting debate, but Karl Lagerfeld’s remarks in Women’s Wear were fairly to the point: “You don’t accept this kind of business if you’re too much of an artist.”By Wednesday, at the close of the shows, it seemed that most people were ready to move on — or, in fact, already had. “We are living in an age where everything moves so quickly, going from one trauma to the next every 15 minutes,” said Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus. “At the end of the day, I’m thinking with a laser focus about six months from now.”So, too, will many designers, whose focus immediately turns to spring 2012.“Once you end, you start again,” Mr. Frasch said. “It’s our business.”
