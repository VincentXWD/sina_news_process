Weapons such as swords, spears, battle-axe, scimitars, shields, crossbows and arrowheads were found at the pits of the terracotta warriors.Some of these weapons such as the swords are still very sharp and found to be coated with chromium oxide. This layer of chromium oxide is 10â€“15 micrometre thick and has kept the swords rust-free and in pristine condition after 2,000 years.Chromium only came to the attention of westerners in the 18th century. Many swords contain an alloy of copper, tin and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt. A Qin crossbow arrow is estimated to have a range of 800 metres.
