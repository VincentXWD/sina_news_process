Who is ready for the warmth and sun? And of course, the new wardrobe! Spring has sprung and it’s time to hit the mall to update your look. The spring trends are already in stores and personally, the arrival of the spring is making me cheerful. This year, the runways were filled with bright color, bold stripes, wild prints, and much more. Let’s explore these trends in detail.Trend 1: FloralsDresses, tops, and shorts will be seen with beautiful and colorful floral designs. Big or small prints, in any style, and all colors are seen in almost every store you walk into right now. These florals will give you a soft, feminine look to play up your girly side.Trend 2: StripesAhoy sailor! Stripes are another pattern that has taken over the stores. Stripes are a dominant part of any spring / summer season, though usually, year on year, featuring a variation on the theme. Red and Blue sailor stripes are the favorite and are a fun style to try. The myth about stripes making you look wider is false! Designers have become very sneaky about placing strips in the right spots on your body to give you a smaller shape. TIP: Vertical strips will give you a lean look!Trend 3: Mixing printsWhy not mix the first two trends together? Mixing prints is a fun way to play up your look and that is very hot this spring. Try wearing a flirty floral skirt with a sailor stripe top for a fun look! Pair it with some cute sandals and a fun handbag, and you’ll be the talk of the town.Trend 4 LaceNEWS FLASH: Lace is not only for undergarments, anymore! (This just might be my favorite trend for this season.) Lace is an excellent way to add detail and splendor to your outfit. Lace can be used as an accent piece with a vest, or a statement piece- being the focal point of your outfit. Lace is not a clingy fabric, and is great for layering, so it hides areas that you are not ready to show off quite yet!Trend 5: Honeysuckle and TealThe colors of the season are sure to get you into stores. Honeysuckle is a delicious shade of sherbet-pink and coral. It is bright and compliments every skin tone. Teal is the trend for jewelry this season and goes with every other color you can imagine. If you are on a budget this season, try adding some bright teal jewelry to your current wardrobe for a new twist on some of your old favorites.Of course, always add your unique flare to the current trends to personalize them. I know I, will be enjoying this year’s trends. What is your favorite look for spring 2011?Megan Beck is Anytime Health’s newest lifestyle blogger.
