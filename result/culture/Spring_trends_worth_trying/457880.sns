Fashion Week always serves up a host of fun trends to try and this spring, thankfully, they were oh-so-wearable. From statement-making prints to cool new color combos, discover tons of new outfit ideas for the warm-weather season ahead. Trust us, you’ll find something you just can’t wait to put on.BlockingSpring runways were more colorful than the crowd at a Lady Gaga concert. Bold, solid-color pieces—like a cardi and skirt, wrap dress or demure one-piece suit—make simple dressing look glam. Our style tip: Stick to three colors max to avoid the girly, Rainbow Brite look.AnoraksSpring 2012’s cool-girl anoraks—as seen at Tommy Hilfiger, Edun and Jason Wu—are a win-win as far as we’re concerned: They fit in with spring’s sporty vibe and promise to make your rainy days look chic. What’s not to love?Super Bold PrintsThere are prints, and then there are PRINTS. All caps are necessary to describe the vibrant, swirling, styled-head-to-toe patterns that sashayed down the spring 2012 runways. While there’s plenty to choose from—oversize florals, mirrorlike geometric shapes, even parrot prints—we like how designer Joseph Altuzarra paired his fruit-punch blazer over a super-simple black top and pants.Oranges and TangerinesJust before New York Fashion Week kicked off, Pantone Institute shared its prediction for the most popular colors of spring 2012, and it was spot-on: The pick for spring’s numero uno shade, Tangerine Tango, was all over the runways. And if tangerine isn’t your citrus of choice, there are plenty more orange hues to choose from. Wear one color and look chic? How easy is that!Pink Shorts SuitsSure, this trend might not have been automatically filed under “wearable,” but we give this leggy-yet-office-appropriate look major props for its versatility: Wear the blazer and shorts separately for a whole new set of cute outfits! Smart dressing, indeed.Futuristic PrintsWith so many pixilated prints and swirling graphics, it’s clear someone’s been having fun with Photoshop. If you’re feeling tired of classic patterns like plaids, stripes and polka dots, then spring 2012’s futuristic-print trend is for you. To keep things in this day and age (and not, say, full-on Jetsons era), pair a techno-print piece with something simple like a won’t-go-out-of-style-for-light-years t-shirt.Pastel Shades If wild, look-at-me hues aren’t your thing, worry not: New York Fashion Week’s most esteemed designers have got your back.(And your front. And your legs. You get the picture). Spring’s sweet sorbet shades and pastel hues give off a low-key, ladylike vibe.  Colorful Camo Camo usually feels heavy-duty, but spring’s versions are more ladylike thanks to soft, pretty pastels. How to pull it off in the urban jungle? Treat it like it goes with everything by styling it up with other patterns and colors and suddenly your friends will be calling on you to merchandise their closets and approve their spring splurges. Keep it stealth—they don’t have to know that your cool new camo did the heavy lifting.  Metallic Basics  Go-to wardrobe favorites—from wrap skirts and slim trousers to stacked heel loafers—turn into going-out gear when they come covered in shiny bronze or liquid emerald green. If you need to have a Footloose moment and steal the dance-floor spotlight, wear one of these!  Peplum skirts, shirts and dresses  Flirt without saying a word in this season’s peplum skirts, dresses and tops, defined by a short flared ruffle that sits at the natural waist (that’s the tiny part!). High heels and your steadiest eyeliner flick will seal the deal on your spring glam plan.
