Chunjie—where Beijing turns into a vast wasteland devoid of people, riddled with gunfire (er, fireworks) and starving laowai looking for the nearest KFC. For those left behind, we’ve got our big list of holiday events to get out of the Chunjie blues.PARTIESChinese New Year at Haze: Enter the dragon with DJs Yang Bing, Donald Summer, Pancake Lee, Jiong Jiong, and Kaize. They’ll be dishing out dumplings at midnight and spinning house into the wee hours. Haze, Jan 22, 9:30pm-5am; Tel: 186-1197-0409; Free entry.Raise the Red Lantern: Lantern is open every day of Chinese New Year—kick off the holiday techno Jan. 22 with fireworks on the dance floor (fire hazard?) and dumplings at 3am. Lantern, Jan 22, 9pm - 5am; Tel: 135-0134-8785.Chinese New Year’s at Orchid with Great Leap: All-you-can-drink Great Leap Beers? It’s on at The Orchid on Chinese New Year’s Eve. Nab them now, as there are only 100 tickets to spare. RMB300 (door), RMB250 (pre-sale). The Orchid Bar, Jan 22, 9pm-1am; Tel: 156-1121-8019Chinese New Year Eve Special at Q Bar: Dragon-themed cocktails and ice sculptures are a few of the surprises that Q Bar will have this year—but we’re banking on the fact that Q Bar’s terrace will boast a lovely view once the Chunjie fireworks get going. And … there will be dumplings. Of course. Q Bar, Jan 22, 9pm-2am; Tel: 6595-9239Chinese New Year Party at Luga's Villa: A great deal on shots (5 Dragon Shots for RMB15) and hongbao for the first 100 guests on New Year's Eve. Even better?

This will be the last Feminite at Haze—and with free cocktails and rose wine for the ladies, we’re thinking this will be the best bet for a quiet Wednesday during Chunjie. Haze, Jan 25, 9pm-3am; Tel: 186-1197-04095th Day of Spring Festival: If you haven’t had enough of fireworks by the 5th day, then head for Yugong Yishan for a night of awesome music with DJ Ouyang and friends … with fireworks.

Don’t hurt yourself, don't set them off drunk and read up on how to do it safely.DRINKYour neighborhood xiaomaibu may be closing, but 7-Eleven, Alldays, Family Mart, Quickmart, etc. will be open and stocked with alcohol of all sorts.As for bars, a surprising amount of them will be operating as usual:12SQMGrinder'sIrish VolunteerThe Stumble InnAnd a few cocktail places will be open as well:CentroQ BarMokihiAlso, Paddy O'Shea's will be open for business from 5pm.GET TEMPLED OUTTemple fairs rarely happen at temples anymore, but the name has stuck. Expect elbow-to-elbow crowds and noise...er, renao. The reason to go to these packed fairs is to enjoy lao Beijing snacks, traditional performances and acrobatics, and lots and lots of dragon paraphernalia. Although Ditan is by far the most famous, we recommend heading to Dongyue Temple (Jan 23 to 28) for a more authentic experience.Ditan Temple Fair: One of the best, and most crowded. A good number of traditional street performances. This fair usually climaxes with a re-enactment of a Qing Dynasty sacrificial ceremony. Be warned that Yonghegong Station is usually shut down during the early part of Chunjie--walk from Beixinqiao station on Line 5 instead. Jan 22-29.Shijingshan Temple Fair: Yes, it's at an amusement park. But there's still plenty to see, including lion dancing, wrestling, kung fu and Chinese crosstalk. Jan 23 to Jan 29.Longtan Temple Fair: The usual suspects of performances, artwork and Chinese snacks. There's a free shuttle bus running from Tiantandongmen station on Line 5. Jan 22-Jan 29Taoranting Guangdian Temple Fair: This fair is best known for showcasing folk art, and is one of the more relaxed temple fairs in town. Get off at Taoranting Station on Line 4. Jan 23-Jan 28.Summer Palace Temple Fair: A temple fair with great photo-ops. We hope the iced-over lake holds out under the hordes of visitors flooding the Summer Palace. Jan 23-Jan 28.Chaoyang Park Temple Fair: An ice sculpture exhibition and a film screening are among the highlights of this more Western-style fair.
