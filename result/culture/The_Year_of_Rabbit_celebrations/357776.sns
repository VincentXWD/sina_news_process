Dozens of workshops in Zhuxianzhen of central China's Henan province are busy making woodblock New Year paintings as the Chinese lunar New Year draws near. As a national intangible cultural heritage, the Zhuxianzheng woodblock New Year paintings first appeared in Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and gained prosperity during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). According to traditional Chinese customs, the paintings are usually placed on doors and walls during the Spring Festival to prevent evil spirits and bring good luck to the family.
