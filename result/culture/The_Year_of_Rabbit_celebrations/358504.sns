Actors performed during a rehearsal of the Spring Festival Gala Evening at China Central Television (CCTV) in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 31, 2011.The first Spring Festival Gala Evening of CCTV was held in 1983. Enjoying the family reunion dinner on Lunar New Year's Eve and watching the annual Spring Festival Gala Evening of CCTV have become a convention for Chinese people. The gala evening paves way to fame for many ordinary actors across the country and makes some phrases popular. With the development of the annual evening, the advertising revenue increases year by year. However, audience rating of the gala evening declines due to more and more critical taste of audience. For people living in southern part of the country, the gala evening having relatively more northern features does not meet their demands commendably. Some southern TV stations plans to broadcast their own programs rather than rebroadcasting the Spring Festival Gala Evening of CCTV.
