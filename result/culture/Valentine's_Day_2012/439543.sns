Chinese people have become more open toward having sex, according to the 2011 Global Durex Sexual Wellbeing Survey released today in Beijing.Initiated by Durex, a leading condom manufacturer, the survey was conducted by Harris Interactive, an independent market research firm during the period from September 6 to October 3, 2011. About 29,000 adults (aged above 18) in 36 countries took part in the survey, either through online questionnaires or interviews. In China, 2060 people accepted to be interviewed via the Internet.Compared with a similar survey in 2006 by the same companies, the result shows sexual attitudes and behaviors have changed a lot among Chinese people.For many people, intimate relationships are not indispensable in their sexual behavior. About 34 percent of people have had more than two sexual partners, while in 2006, the number was only 28 percent.On the one hand, only 30 percent of people think love is a precondition for sexual activity, while in 2006, about 52 percent of respondents thought that way. One the other hand, one night stands have become more acceptable, and about 10 percent of the respondents said they have experienced a one night stand.Society is also more tolerant of homosexuality, the report says. However, the survey also indicates that overall sexual satisfaction among Chinese people has declined.Although physical satisfaction increased from 73 percent in 2006 to 78 percent in 2011, emotional satisfaction decreased from 85 percent to 80 percent.In 2006, about 16 percent of people agreed that they didn't have enough love, and in 2011, that increased to 27 percent.Although many people look confident, they are not comfortable in talking about sex with their partners, and they don't care if their partners are satisfied.The survey also indicates that society has not been successful in sex education.The Internet is the most popular source of sex information, and about 50 percent of people say they learn about sex though the Internet.About 20 percent of respondents say primary and secondary schools are their main source of sex education, while 13 percent refer to their university, while another 13 percent found information in newspapers and magazines. About 18 percent of respondents have not received any sex education at all.The internet has greatly influenced relationships and sexual wellbeing among the current generation. People are more confident and feel more attractive online, and are more open to using dating websites, and some people use the Internet to find sexual partners.At the same time, people are having sex at a younger age compared with previous generations. People who first had sex between the ages of 16-18 years old have increased by 10 percent since 2006.About a quarter of the respondents are not aware of the sexual diseases history of their partners, and over 40 percent say they are lost when they first experience sex.The survey also indicates that compared with other countries, Chinese people have a higher frequency of sexual intercourse.
