Love Thee by Eliza ActonI love thee, as I love the calmOf sweet, star-lighted hours! I love thee, as I love the balmOf early jes'mine flow'rs. I love thee, as I love the lastRich smile of fading day, Which lingereth, like the look we cast,On rapture pass'd away. I love thee as I love the toneOf some soft-breathing flute Whose soul is wak'd for me alone,When all beside is mute.I love thee as I love the firstYoung violet of the spring; Or the pale lily, April-nurs'd,To scented blossoming. I love thee, as I love the full,Clear gushings of the song, Which lonely--sad--and beautiful--At night-fall floats along, Pour'd by the bul-bul forth to greetThe hours of rest and dew; When melody and moonlight meetTo blend their charm, and hue. I love thee, as the glad bird lovesThe freedom of its wing, On which delightedly it movesIn wildest wandering.I love thee as I love the swell,And hush, of some low strain, Which bringeth, by its gentle spell,The past to life again. Such is the feeling which from theeNought earthly can allure: 'Tis ever link'd to all I seeOf gifted--high--and pure!？La Vita Nuova by Dante AlighieriIn that book which isMy memory . . .On the first pageThat is the chapter when I first met youAppear the words . . .Here begins a new lifeAt Last by Elizabeth Akers AllenAt last, when all the summer shineThat warmed life's early hours is past, Your loving fingers seek for mineAnd hold them close—at last—at last! Not oft the robin comes to buildIts nest upon the leafless bough By autumn robbed, by winter chilled,—But you, dear heart, you love me now.Though there are shadows on my browAnd furrows on my cheek, in truth,— The marks where Time's remorseless ploughBroke up the blooming sward of Youth,— Though fled is every girlish graceMight win or hold a lover's vow, Despite my sad and faded face,And darkened heart, you love me now!I count no more my wasted tears;They left no echo of their fall; I mourn no more my lonesome years;This blessed hour atones for all. I fear not all that Time or FateMay bring to burden heart or brow,— Strong in the love that came so late,Our souls shall keep it always now!Longingby Matthew ArnoldCome to me in my dreams, and thenBy day I shall be well again.For then the night will more than payThe hopeless longing of the day.Come, as thou cam'st a thousand times,A messenger from radiant climes,And smile on thy new world, and beAs kind to others as to me.Or, as thou never cam'st in sooth,Come now, and let me dream it truth.And part my hair, and kiss my brow,And say My love! why sufferest thou?Come to me in my dreams, and then、By day I shall be well again.For then the night will more than payThe hopeless longing of the day.Habitation by Margaret AtwoodMarriage is not a house or even a tentit is before that, and colder:the edge of the forest, the edge of the desert the unpainted stairs at the back where we squat outside, eating popcornthe edge of the receding glacierwhere painfully and with wonder at having survived even this farwe are learning to make fireLullaby by W. H. AudenLay Your Sleeping head, my love,Human on my faithless arm:Time and fevers burn awayIndividual beauty fromThoughtful children, and the graveProves the child ephemeral:But in my arms till break of dayLet the living creature lie,Mortal, guilty, but to meThe entirely beautiful.Soul and body have no bounds:To lovers as they lie uponHer tolerant enchanted slopeIn their ordinary swoon,Grave the visionVenus sendsOf supernatural sympathy,Universal love and hope;While an abstract insight wakesAmong the glaciers and the rocksThe hermit's carnal ecstasy,Certainty, fidelityOn the stroke of midnight passLike vibrations of a bellAnd fashionable madmen raiseTheir pedantic boring cry:Every farthing of the cost.All the dreaded cards foretell.Shall be paid, but from this nightNot a whisper, not a thought.Not a kiss nor look be lost.Beauty, midnight, vision dies:Let the winds of dawn that blowSoftly round your dreaming headSuch a day of welcome showEye and knocking heart may bless,Find our mortal world enough;Noons of dryness find you fedBy the involuntary powers,Nights of insult let you passWatched by every human love.
