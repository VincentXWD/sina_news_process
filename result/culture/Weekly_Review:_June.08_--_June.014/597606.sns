A string quartet from The Philadelphia Orchestra made a lengthy flight delay quite enjoyable for a plane full of lucky passengers in China.Two violinists, a cellist and a viola player were aboard a flight that was delayed for three hours on the tarmac in Beijing on Friday. They took out their instruments and played an impromptu concert for the appreciative — if captive — audience. Several passengers whipped out smartphones and began recording as the orchestra played a selection from Dvorak's "American" string quartet.The instrumentalists were greeted with cheers and applause as they wrapped up their five-and-a-half-minute performance.A video of the quickie concert was posted online.The ensemble recently launched a tour of China, 40 years after it became the first U.S. orchestra to visit the country.___Online:Video of concert aboard plane: http://bit.ly/195BrrC
