And Sharapova has not had a winning  record against the American in their last 13 meetings.The 32-year-old Williams has collected five titles at the Australian  Open, five at Wimbledon, four at the US Open and two at the French Open.Williams said in French to the crowd that it is "incredible" to win her second title 11 years after her first.Sharapova, who won one title at each Grand Slam event, said: "I  played a great tournament and ran against a really tough champion. She's  been playing so well throughout this year so a big congratulation to  her.""This court has brought me so many nice memories. Last year was  incredibly special for me and to be back on this stage and be the last  two players in the tournament is special, I would have loved to have won  it but I'll be back next year trying to win it again."
