FRENCH President Francois Hollande said yesterday that the European Union must work with China and called for a balanced resolution to an escalating trade dispute that began with solar panels but has since spread to European wines.Speaking at a conference with business representatives in Tokyo, Hollande said France's goal was to sell more products to China but that there needed to be clear ground rules and more cooperation."We need to work with China ... to develop our economies but also to define rules, principles and to open new areas of cooperation," Hollande said. "We need to resolve our trade problems with China through discussion, without advantages being given to one country over another."Â
