The Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has recommended the filing of criminal charges against the Filipino coast guards involved in the shooting death of a Taiwanese fisherman, the Inquirer learned on Tuesday.A source, who has knowledge of the investigation of the incident but asked not to be identified because he has no authority to speak on the matter, declined to say whether murder or homicide charges had been recommended.But the source said there was a debate on whether to bring murder charges against the coast guards, as "superior strength" was used against an unarmed civilian, or homicide, as the shooting death of fisherman Hung Shih-chen was "not premeditated".The source said the NBI report on the investigation of Hung's death had been submitted to Justice Secretary Leila de Lima."It is a thin report, because the annexes have yet to be forwarded to [Secretary De Lima]," the source said.The report, according to the source, includes the identities of the coast guards who fired their rifles at Hung's fishing boat in waters off Balintang Island on May 9.It also contains the identity of the coast guard who fired the bullet that killed Hung, the source said.The shooter was identified through a cross-match between the slug recovered from Hung's body during autopsy and the signature of the coast guard's M14 rifle.(Agencies)
