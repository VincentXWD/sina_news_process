Xi Jinping, general secretary of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Thursday called on  the Chinese mainland and Taiwan to "heal the historical trauma" and set  the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as their common goal.While meeting with visiting Honorary Chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT)  Party Wu Poh-Hsiung, Xi offered four proposals on furthering relations  across the Taiwan Strait.First, the two sides should take the overall interests of the Chinese  nation into consideration when assessing the overall situation of  cross-Strait ties, he said."Though the mainland and Taiwan are yet to be reunified, they belong  to one China and are inseparable parts of the country," he said.Safeguarding national territorial integrity and sovereignty is at the  core of this goal, Xi said, stressing that the two sides should uphold  the one-China framework.Second, the two sides should clearly recognize development trends  throughout history in order to gain a better understanding of the future  prospects for cross-Strait ties, he added."The peaceful development of cross-Strait ties has become an  important part of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," Xi  said.He called on the two sides to break free from out-dated concepts that  do not suit the current situation, "heal the historical trauma" and put  the Chinese nation's rejuvenation as their common goal.In the third point, Xi noted that the mainland and Taiwan should  enhance mutual trust, engage in favorable interactions, seek common  ground and shelve differences, and be pragmatic and enterprising.The key to enhancing mutual trust, Xi explained, lies in fostering a  shared perspective and position on upholding the one-China framework.To engage in favorable interactions, Xi said, both sides should  safeguard the hard-won peaceful development of cross-Strait ties and  resolve problems between them in a reasonable manner."Seeking common ground and shelving differences" requires both sides  to rally political wisdom, pool and expand consensus on promoting the  development of cross-Strait ties and manage differences appropriately,  Xi added.To prevent setbacks in the development of cross-Strait ties, he also  urged both sides not to get stalled by difficulties or disturbances in  advancing the relationship.Finally, he said the two sides should steadily promote the overall development of cross-Strait ties.In his final point, Xi put priority on maintaining stability in the  cross-Strait relationship. "Taiwan independence" secessionist forces and  activities remain threats to peace across the Strait, and both sides  must continue to combat and contain all forms of "Taiwan independence"  advocacy or activities. They should never yield in this front, Xi said.He also called for both sides to facilitate efforts in expanding fields of cooperation and improving the quality of cooperation.Xi also stressed that more people should benefit from the peaceful  development of cross-Strait relations. He called for efforts to allow  people from both sides to realize that the mainland and Taiwan share the  same destiny and to inspire them to strengthen their pride in the  Chinese nation as well as their shared goal of its rejuvenation.The two sides have developed "a correct path" for the peaceful  development of cross-Strait relations over the past five years,  according to Xi.The CPC Central Committee will maintain consistency in existing  policies toward Taiwan by promoting the peaceful development of  cross-Strait ties so as to bring greater well-being to compatriots  across the Strait and the Chinese nation, he said.During the meeting, Wu Poh-Hsiung stressed that adhering to the "1992  consensus" and opposing "Taiwan independence" are the positions of both  the KMT and CPC, adding that both sides define the cross-Strait  relationship within the one-China framework -- not as a  country-to-country relationship.Honoring the long-held principle of the KMT, KMT Chairman Ma  Ying-jeou recently reiterated that he will not promote "Two Chinas,"  "one China, one Taiwan" or "Taiwan independence," Wu said.Additionally, Wu said that as the cross-Strait relationship ushers in  a new era, both the KMT and the CPC should shoulder the responsibility  of rejuvenating the Chinese nation through concerted efforts.During their meeting, Wu relayed Ma's greetings to Xi, and Xi asked Wu to convey his regards to Ma.On Thursday, top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng also met with Wu and  his visiting delegation, vowing to fully consider the demands and  benefits of compatriots from Taiwan amid deepening cross-Strait  exchanges and cooperation."A concept should be strengthened to regard people from the mainland  and Taiwan as one family, and specific goals should be set down to  achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with joint efforts from  both sides," Yu said.While meeting with Yu, Wu also stressed that the cross-Strait  relations are at a key period and the two parties should deepen mutual  political trust and enhance negotiations in order to resolve conflicting  views.Yu hailed Xi's meeting with Wu as having reached many significant  agreements that will boost the peaceful development of cross-Strait  relations as well as promote mutual trust between the two parties.
