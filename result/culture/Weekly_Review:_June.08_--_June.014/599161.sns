China refused to be drawn yesterday on revelations of US electronic surveillance and on the American in Hong Kong who leaked the information."We have seen the relevant reports, but I regret that I have no information to give you on this," foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in China's first official response to questions about the case.Hua also refused to comment on any possible extradition request from the United States or any move by Edward Snowden to seek asylum in Hong Kong.Cybersecurity is a major issue between China and the United States and was one of the main topics on the agenda at the first summit between President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama last week.Hua repeated China's position that it is one of the world's biggest victims of hacking and noted that Washington and Beijing had agreed to discuss the issue.However, she added: "On the issue of Internet security we believe that having double standards does not help find an appropriate resolution."The reaction was stronger online. Air Force Colonel Dai Xu, known for the hawkish opinions he voices on his Sina Weibo microblog, wrote: "I have always said, the United States' accusations about Chinese hacking attacks have always been a case of a thief crying for another thief to be caught."Snowden's allegations about US hacking add a new twist to the long-running battle between Washington and Beijing over cybersecurity.The US has been delivering a series of reports accusing China of computer-based attacks against America.Snowden's allegations follow comments last week from China's Internet security chief, who said Beijing has amassed huge amounts of data on US-based hacking.
