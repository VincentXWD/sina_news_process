Hilton Worldwide plans to open at least 120 new hotels in China in the next three to four years as it taps an increasing number of domestic travelers to boost income.By 2015, Hilton will be present in 75 domestic cities as it taps growth in key gateway cities and lower tier cities, said Martin Rinck, president of Hilton Worldwide Asia Pacific."China still has a huge potential for more new hotels in the long term, with both domestic business and leisure travel expected to climb higher," Rinck said in a recent interview with Shanghai Daily.China accounts for over 70 percent of Hilton Worldwide's new openings in Asia Pacific, cementing the country's significance in its global network."We also plans to have more than 55,000 rooms in about four to five years in China compared with the current 12,000 rooms and China is expected to account for half of the Asia Pacific's operating facilities and that demonstrates our long-term commitment to the country," Rinck said.He said the Hilton and the Double Tree brands are the fastest growing in China. In April, Hilton launched its fifth brand, the Garden Inn, to further tap into China's upscale travel market. Hilton now has 32 hotels in China's mainland under five brands.Hilton recently opened offices in Shenzhen and Beijing as "we believe the outlook of China's hospitality industry is positive," Rinck said.
