South Korea's education ministry said Friday it plans to call on Japan to correct its distorted history textbooks laying claim to the South Korean islets of Dokdo(Japan called "Takeshima").In March, Japan approved 21 high-school textbooks, some of which describe Dokdo, a group of rocky outcroppings lying in the East Sea between the two countries, as a Japanese territory.According to the report the ministry submitted to the National Assembly, the government plans to send a formal request to Japan asking it to correct the wrongful contents.(Agencies)
