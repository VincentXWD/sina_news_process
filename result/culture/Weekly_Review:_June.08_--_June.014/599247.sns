Honda Motor will recall more than 380,000 cars in Japan due to a problem with the drive shaft, the government said on Thursday.The recall will cover a total of 384,614 units across five models, including N BOX, manufactured between December 2011 and May this year, Japanâ€™s transport ministry said after Honda submitted its plan to the authority.The drive shaft on these vehicles could be damaged due to the malfunction of the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) system, said the ministry citing the automaker.No accidents have been reported but the company has received three customer complaints, a Honda spokesman said, adding that the recall will not affect its products overseas.(Agencies)
