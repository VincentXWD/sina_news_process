BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhuanet) -- The Transformers are now in China. Director Michael Bay appeared in Shanghai on Thursday, alongside "Transformers 3" actor Shia LaBeouf and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as part of a promotional tour in anticipation of the film's upcoming Chinese mainland release.The latest installment of the Transformers series, entitled "Dark of the Moon", opens in Chinese mainland cinemas on July 21. The movie has topped the North American box office for two weeks since its opening.Chinese media attending the press conference expressed great interest in the director's choice of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley over Megan Fox as the female lead. Fox was the female lead in the previous two movies.Bay told reporters, "I wanted someone new, fresh, different. Basically, the relationship was boy meets girl in the first movie. The second movie, the boy has the girl. The third movie, they are [only] 22 years old. Do they get married and have kids at 22? So we decided to get a new girl."Bay added, pointing at the model-turned actress sitting nearby, "Beautiful girl right here. She did wonderful job acting."As for a Chinese milk brand that has found its way into the movie, local media questioned the director regarding the issue of product placement.Bay responded that the milk is used simply as a comedy tool. "I'm not here doing commercials for a product," he said, "I'm not doing an ad for milk here. We are doing a movie called 'Transformers'."(Source: CRIENGLISH.com)
