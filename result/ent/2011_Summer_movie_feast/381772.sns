Where to catch Transformers 3 in 3-D IMAX 
2011-07-20 09:49:37 GMT
Although we’ve seen many a 3-D movie where the 3-D action was minimal at best, Transformers 3’s 3-D version, produced by James Cameron, really is as good as it promises, especially if you’re watching it in an IMAX theater. Here we’ve listed a few IMAX theaters around town showing Optimus Prime and the crew for your 3-D viewing pleasure.Currently there are five IMAX screens in UME Haidian, Wanda Shijingshan, Wanda CBD, UME Haidian, Science and Technology Museum IMAX Theater and China National Film Museum.UME Haidian was Beijing’s first IMAX theater, and the place is always crowded. When Avatar was screening there, crowds lined up for tickets starting at 9am. Although the IMAX at Science and Technology Museum is said to be the largest IMAX in Asia, many still prefer an IMAX experience at the China National Film Museum, which has the lowest IMAX ticket prices in town.If you don’t mind a bit of a hike and lineups for tickets, the National Film Museum is the place for you. For cinemas across the board, reservations are only available to members, and phone lines are always busy or out of service. Don’t waste time trying to call for a reservation or buy tickets online. Just show up at the theater. If you want to beat the crowds, wait a week after a new release before making the trek to the theater of your choice.
