BEIJING, August 1(Xinhuanet) -- Sony's "The Smurfs" and Universal's "Cowboys & Aliens" tied for the first place at North American Box Office this weekend, according to AP's report.Both newly-debuted movies earn an estimated 36.2 million U.S. dollars each, with the winner to be unveiled when final numbers are counted Monday."In all my years, I've never really seen a race this close," said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. "Generally, in the world of movie box office, one million dollars are a close call, so to have two films in a dollar-to-dollar tie is somewhat unprecedented."Previously, some analysts predicted that the science-fiction "Cowboys & Aliens" will surpass the family adventure "The Smurfs" with an estimated 40 million dollars and more, while the latter may reach about three million dollars.However, the two movies tied on top of box office in the middle.(Agencies)
