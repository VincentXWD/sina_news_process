BEIJING, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited Chinese mainland release of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" on Thursday has many of the nation's Harry Potter fans crying tears of joy as they prepare to say goodbye to one of their favorite fictitious magicians.Yin Pingping, 23, is just one of the country's millions of Harry Potter fans. She owns the entire series of Harry Potter novels in English, Chinese and Japanese, and claims to have read all of them over ten times apiece."This is the curtain call for our childhood," said Yin, who plans to attend Thursday's premier dressed in a black hat and a magic wand.The Harry Potter series, written by British author J.K. Rowling, was translated into Chinese in 2000. The film versions of the novels debuted in China two years later.The novels have seen Harry Potter facing supernatural foes, as well as everyday adolescent challenges such as exams and arguments with friends. These experiences deeply resonated with Yin and her peers. The arrival of the final movie itself is like a rite of passage, according to Yin."Years have gone by, and now you can see Harry wearing a beard and Emma (Watson, Harry Potter film actress) appearing on the cover of Vogue magazine," Yin said. "We have all grown up."Yin recalled the first time she read the Harry Potter novels, commenting that they changed her life significantly from day one."It was a magical world where I could forget my bad scores and my inability to study," Yin said.Yin used her interest in the teenage wizard to set up a "Harry Potter Club" at her university, eventually attracting over 400 members and introducing her to a whole new circle of friends.Sun Yue, a student from Nanjing University in east China's Jiangsu Province, said that the Harry Potter films and novels brought him a great deal of pleasure and courage.The 22-year-old physics student adapted a play based on the second Harry Potter film when he was a freshman. He claims that he has "never missed" any products related to Harry Potter, purchasing "magical" staves, games and other merchandise."I don't want to see the end of Harry Potter," Sun said reluctantly.Ma Ainong, a translator who helped introduce Harry Potter to Chinese readers in 2000, believes that the character's legacy will endure for years. Although she is not a personal fan of the stories, she said that she thinks he will continue to be popular in the future."The Harry Potter series will continue to draw more readers," Ma said."The story we love best still lives with us together. Hogwarts will always be here to welcome you home," said J.K Rowling at the global premiere of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" in London on July 15.The eight Harry Potter movies released thus far have swept the global market by grossing over 7 billion U.S. dollars in box offices around the world, according to Warner Bros. Pictures.Two-thirds of the tickets available for the film's midnight debut in Beijing have already been sold out, according to the city's Meijia Cinema.
