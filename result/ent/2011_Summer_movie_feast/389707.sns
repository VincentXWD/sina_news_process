"No matter how hard you try to follow the rules, sooner or later, a part of you will be lost."This is the third time the 56-year-old will see his work competing in the festival. However, neither of his other two films, Exiled and The Mad Detective, picked up an award.To directs and produces the film, which stars Lau Ching Wan, Denise Ho and Terence Yin.Another veteran Hong Kong filmmaker, Ann Hui, will challenge To with A Simple Life.The tearjerker is based on a real story about the film's producer Roger Lee and a family servant, who took care of him for more than 60 years. For Lee, the film is a tribute to his old friend, now dead.Hong Kong's superstar Andy Lau and senior actress Deanie Ip lead the film, marking their first venture together in 23 years.Unlike To and Hui, 43-year-old Wei Te-sheng from Taiwan is a newcomer to the industry, with just one film, the 2008 romantic hit Cape No 7, under his belt.Wei joins the competition with an ambitious work titled Seediq Bale, literally "A Real Man". The 135-minute film depicts Taiwan aboriginal Seediq's fight against the Japanese rulers in 1930. John Woo produces the film, starring Taiwan actress Vivian Hsu and Landy Wen.This year's Venice festival runs from Aug 31 to Sept 10 and includes a "surprise film", a feature introduced by director Marco Muller, when he took over in 2004.In all, 23 films are in the run for the Golden Lion this year.
