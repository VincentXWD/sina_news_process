Jane Fonda gave the 65th Annual Cannes Film Festival one of its best looks on Thursday in a stretch, form-fitting, two-tone gown by Stella McCartney.The graphic black-and-white combo created a long, lean silhouette — from the round neckline to the floor-length hem — on the 74-year-old star."Wow!" said fashion commentator Mary Alice Stephenson. "Jane proves that great style and glamour is ageless."Fonda posed ahead of the screening of "Rust and Bone" with Freida Pinto, who made a bold choice of her own: a neon-green, sheer-lace gown dusted in Swarovski crystals and with gold-wave detailing at the waist by Atelier Versace.Also on the red carpet was Eva Longoria in Emilio Pucci. It was a white gown with a plunging neckline and sheer geometric inserts."By pairing a dramatic, glamorous gown with undone but sleek and sensual hair and makeup her look feels modern and 'now,'" Stephenson said.While Longoria left her hair long, Marion Cotillard pulled hers into an oversized bun with a jeweled band. She wore a Dior Haute Couture strapless gown with a black belted bustier and a navy tulle skirt. For the more casual photo call earlier in the day, Cotillard wore a gold-belted Dior dress of taupe chiffon with sequins.(Agencies)
