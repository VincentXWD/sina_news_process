Nastassja Kinski presented the Award for Best Screenplay to Romanian director Cristian Mungiu for Beyond the Hills. "It's wonderful to be here together," he said, "but let us not forget that this is a true story, inspired by real events, and that people have really suffered. If we cannot repair the past, we can hope for the future".
