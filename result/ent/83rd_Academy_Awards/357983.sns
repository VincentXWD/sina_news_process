This winter might not be such a cold one for Jennifer Lawrence. In Winter's Bone, the 20-year-old actress played a 17-year-old girl in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and her siblings while she tries to hunt down her drug-dealing father. Her role as Ree has been heralded her "breakout performance," and the Oscar noms confirms it.
