A late-season push helped Michelle Williams earn a nomination for her work in Blue Valentine. The indie drama starred Williams and Ryan Gosling as a hastily married couple slowly realizing that love alone isn't enough to live on. It's the second nomination for Williams, who was also nominated for Brokeback Mountain in 2006.
