Danny Boyle's follow-up to the wildly successful and Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire picked up three Oscar nominations thanks in large part to the much-lauded performance of James Franco.127 Hours is a 2010 biographical adventure film produced, co-written and directed by Danny Boyle. The film stars James Franco as real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a boulder in Robbers Roost, Utah, for more than five days in 2003. The film, based on Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place, was written by Boyle and Simon Beaufoy and produced by Christian Colson, who previously teamed up for Slumdog Millionaire, and John Smithson. The film was well-received by critics and was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor (James Franco).
