The Coen Brothers' most successful film to date -- its grossed nearly $130 million to date -- True Grit also got a nod for Best Picture at the 2011 Academy Awards. What can we say? Everyone loves a good Western.Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross's father has been shot in cold blood by the coward Tom Chaney, and she is determined to bring him to justice. Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, she sets out with him -- over his objections -- to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man.
