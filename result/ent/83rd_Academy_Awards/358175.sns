This indie drama picked up a surprise nomination for Best Picture. The compelling bit of Ozark noir followed a girl attempting to find her father in the trailers and backwoods of rural Missouri. "What we've been waiting for: a work of art that grabs hold and won't let go," gushed The New Yorker.Winter's Bone is a 2010 drama film, an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel of the same name. The film was written and directed by Debra Granik, and stars Jennifer Lawrence. It explores the interrelated themes of close and distant family ties, the power and speed of gossip, patriarchy, self-sufficiency, and rural poverty in the Ozarks as they are impacted by the pervasive underworld of illegal methamphetamine labs. The film has won a number of awards, including the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. It received four Academy Award 2011 nominations in the categories of Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.
