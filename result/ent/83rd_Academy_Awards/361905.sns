Moments we'll remember from the 2011 Oscars

Oscar winners will take home a nice, heavy statuette, but what will we, the viewers, take home from this year's Oscarcast? Herewith, some moments to remember, marvel at, cry at, frown at or simply scratch our heads at:THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT BOMB:OK, let's get right to it. Was Melissa Leo channeling her role in "The Fighter" when she unleashed the F-word in her acceptance speech as best supporting actress? Suitable, though, when you consider her salty turn as Mark Wahlberg's relentless mom. Maybe she was frazzled not only by her Oscar win, but also by flirting with presenter Kirk Douglas ("What are you doing later?" she asked him.) Leo's language malfunction quickly become a running theme. "I'm not gonna drop the F-Bomb like she did, but I've done it plenty," quipped fellow "Fighter" winner and best supporting actor Christian Bale. Original screenplay winner David Seidler ("The King's Speech") thanked the Queen of England "for not putting me in the Tower of London for using the Melissa Leo F-word."AND SPEAKING OF DOUGLAS:Yes, his lengthy presentation — and teasing before announcing the winner — may have threatened to overshadow the actual award, but so what? Douglas, 94, was still charming, showing he retains an eye for the ladies, a taste for showmanship, and was even game to joke about his cane.YES, THEY REALLY ARE HIP AND CUTE:Hosts James Franco and Anne Hathaway got right to the point in their opening moments, cleverly mocking the talk about how their purpose was to lure a younger audience. He told her she looked "so beautiful and so hip." She replied: "You look very appealing to a younger demographic as well." Their taped montage may have borrowed from Billy Crystal, with the actors inserting themselves into nominated films. But it was fun. A highlight: the actors invading a "Black Swan" rehearsal studio, she as a tap-dancing Brown Duck, he in an all-body white leotard that made him look more uncomfortable than when he cut off his arm in "127 Hours."AND SPEAKING OF CRYSTAL:The new hosts were appealing, but was the audience yearning for a comedian's touch — and some better jokes — when it gave Crystal a standing ovation before he even said a word? Yes or no, he had the grateful crowd laughing right away. "So, where was I?" he quipped, then advised the crowd that since things were running late, he was going to go straight to the Best Picture award. Even funnier was a clip of Bob Hope's classic Oscar joke that the awards were known in his home as "Passover." Ba dum bum.TEEN (FASHION) QUEEN:Hailee Steinfeld may have lost her first Oscar race, but the precocious 14-year-old from "True Grit" was victorious on the red carpet in a shimmery, blush-colored gown with a tiara-like headband. Totally age-appropriate, pronounced fashion guru Tim Gunn. And gorgeous. Here's hoping she's back again soon.GIVE HER A BROADWAY SHOW:We already knew Hathaway could sing from a previous Oscar cameo. But she really let her pipes rip in a "Les Miz"-inspired number. Sure, it was puzzling to many why she was singing about being stood up by Hugh Jackman. Still, the girl can belt.(Agencies)
