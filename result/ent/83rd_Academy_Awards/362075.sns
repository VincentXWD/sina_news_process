The talent-packed field at the 2011 Oscars left plenty of room for nominees that could have very easily walked away with the award. Here's our (completely speculative) list of who almost won.Some of Hollywood's top talent is inevitably snubbed at the Academy Awards every year. Such is the nature of picking just one winner in each category. Here's a list of this year's second place nominees who almost took home an Oscar.1. Hailee SteinfeldBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESSThe Academy loves to recognize the work of young actors like Hailee Steinfeld, but it rarely awards them with a golden statue. Despite this and Hailee's Golden Globe snub, the 14-year-old True Grit star was probably very close to winning an Oscar Sunday night.2. Geoffrey RushBest Supporting ActorLet's be real. This was Christian Bale's year. The guy hadn't so much as been nominated for an Oscar before The Fighter. But the late-season swing toward The King's Speech surely sent some of Christian's votes the way of Geoffrey Rush, who starred alongside Best Actor winner Colin Firth.3. Annette BeningBEST ACTRESSThe foil to Natalie Portman's over-the-top performance in Black Swan was Annette Bening's firmly-grounded alpha matron in The Kids Are All Right. Her nuanced take on a lesbian mom trying to hold her family together has been widely recognized by critics, and garnered her the Golden Globe for Best Actress. While Natalie was the frontrunner going into the competition, Oscar voters could have easily swayed toward Annette at the last minute.4. James FrancoBEST ACTOREven Oscar host James Franco knew this was Colin Firth's year, but that shouldn't diminish his performance in 127 Hours. The 32-year-old actor single-handedly (get it?) carried the movie into Oscar territory by being almost the only face shown on screen in the 94-minute film.5. David FincherBEST DIRECTORMomentum seemed to favor late favorite The King's Speech at the cost of The Social Network. David Fincher has been winning acclaim in Hollywood ever since he burst onto the scene with 1995's noir detective story Seven. That this year's directing award went to Tom Hooper feels a little bit wrong. At some point Fincher will likely win his Oscar, but his most poignant work will likely be remembered as The Social Network.6. RestrepoBEST DOCUMENTARYThe award for Best Documentary often goes to the most relevant film, and this year Academy voters deemed Inside Job to be the most relevant. But anyone interested in an unflinching look at day-to-day life for American soldiers fighting in Afganistan should see Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington's tension-filled documentary, Restrepo.7. How to Train Your Dragon BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILMIt pretty much sucks to be any animated feature film going up against a Pixar movie. They don't win every year, but unfortunately the charming awesomeness of How to Train Your Dragon was crushed this year by the awards machine that was Toy Story 3.
