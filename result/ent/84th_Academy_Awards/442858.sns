Oscar-nominated actress Michelle Williams was one of the few actresses who displayed the talent and drive to parlay success on a primetime teen drama into a career as a respected film actress. She spent six seasons on the flagship adolescent offering, "Dawson's Creek" (The WB, 1998-2003), while spending her summers building a fan base of independent film fans in smart, dark comedies and dramatic explorations of the twenty-something experience.
