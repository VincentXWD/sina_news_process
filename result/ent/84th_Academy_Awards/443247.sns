Nominees - Best actor George Clooney
2012-02-26 05:23:24 GMT
After a decade spent toiling on series television, mostly in roles easily forgotten, actor George Clooney jolted to stardom with his portrayal of the charming but troubled pediatrician Doug Ross on the acclaimed medical series, "ER" (NBC, 1994-2009). Thanks to his newfound celebrity, Clooney made the jump to films while still on the series, quickly establishing himself as a major Hollywood player with leading roles in "From Dusk Till Dawn" (1996), "Batman & Robin" (1997) and "Out of Sight" (1998). When he left the confines of the small screen for big screen pastures, Clooney transcended mere stardom to become one of the most prominent actors of his era, emulating the devil-may-care nonchalance of a Cary Grant or Clark Gable, while at the same time, becoming an Academy Award-winning performer, risk-taking director, and socially-conscious activist. While raking in the box office as the breezy Danny Ocean in "Ocean's Eleven" (2001) and its two sequels, Clooney forged ahead on a directing career with "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" (2002). But it was his sophomore effort behind the camera, "Good Night, and Good Luck" (2005), that catapulted the star into the realm of top-ranking filmmakers, thanks to a number of Academy Award nominations. Meanwhile, his Oscar-winning performance as a disillusioned CIA agent in "Syriana" (2005), a jaded executive in "Up in the Air" (2009) and a widowed father in "The Descendants" (2011) helped put to rest any residual notions that Clooney was just a famously devout bachelor out to have a good time and make simple popcorn movies.
