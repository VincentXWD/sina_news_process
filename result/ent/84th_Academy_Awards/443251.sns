Soon landing roles as typical good guys, he parlayed his burgeoning heart-throb appeal into Hollywood clout to get prestige personal projects such as Seven Years In Tibet off the ground. Picking up Academy Award nods for 1995 thriller 12 Monkeys, and The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button in 2009, he also turned in critically acclaimed performances in Fight Club and Snatch.Often linked to his co-stars, such as Julia Ormond and Juliette Lewis, Brad fell for Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow when they were filming 1995 psychological thriller Se7en. Although they went on to became engaged, the relationship foundered in June 1997.The following summer he was spotted in an embrace with Friends actress Jennifer Aniston at a New York concert. Romance continued to blossom and, on July 29, 2000, they tied the knot in a cliff top ceremony in California.By 2005 the relationship was in trouble, however, and in autumn of that year they divorced.The official paperwork was still making its way through court when the actor became linked to another famous Tinseltown beauty, his Mr & Mrs Smith co-star Angelina Jolie. While both initially denied being involved, they were soon spotted jetting the globe together on humanitarian missions, along with the Lara Croft star's adopted children.When that December Brad filed to adopt Angelina's children - Maddox, a boy from Cambodia and an Ethiopian girl called Zahara - their relationship seemed confirmed. It wasn't until January 2006 when representatives for both screen talents revealed they were expecting a baby together that their liaison became official, however.Daughter Shiloh Nouvel entered the world amid much media fanfare on May 2006, and the following March the family expanded again with the adoption of Vietnamese orphan Pax Thien. In July 2008 the Jolie-Pitt clan grew again when the couple welcomed their twins Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline.
