In perhaps the most surprising fashion choice of the evening, Helen Hunt hit the Oscar red carpet decked in -- wait for it -- H&M.The Best Supporting Actress nominee was happy to boast to E!'s Ryan Seacrest about the origin of her get-up. When Seacrest couldn't believe her choice, Hunt explained, "Isn't that sexy?"Hunt had eco-friendly reasons for picking the navy gown, explaining she chose H&M because, "they made a beautiful dress and they are going green." The retailer works with Global Green, which Hunt has been collaborating with to fight climate change. In promoting the good cause and wearing something she already owned, Hunt explained, "It's a win, win, win!"Saturday at the Independent Spirit Awards Helen gave a hint about her Oscar ensemble plans, stating that it would be something already hanging in her closet. "I don't know what Iâ€™m wearing, but I own it. It's just my clothes," Hunt said.But the actress didn't walk the carpet without adding a little bit of glam to the H&M frock, accentuating the dress with $700,000 worth of jewelry.(Agencies)
