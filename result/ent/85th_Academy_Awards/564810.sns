Do not adjust your picture: that's really a real housewife on the Oscar red carpet."Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Brandi Glanville was not someone most expected to see mingling with the A-list outside the Dolby Theatre, but she was there doing her best racy Ariel impersonation.Glanville donned a nude, mermaid-style gown, remarkable for its eyebrow-raising top. The gown, with a barely there bodice that looks seconds away from a wardrobe malfunction, also included a thigh-high slit showcasing the 40-year-old reality star's long legs.If Glanville's gown continues to receive negative reviews, the only person Glanville has to blame is… herself! The reality star told RumorFix that she was designing her own Oscar gown for her "My BrandB" line. From the looks of her creation, she could have taken some notes from celebrities who pushed the envelope successfully.For example, Katharine McPhee turned heads with a plunging gown at the Golden Globes this year -- although the cleavage was daring, the rest of the look was toned down to keep it classy. Jennifer Lawrence wore a dress with major exposure and stunned at Saturday’s Independent Spirit Awards. Although it showed some skin, it didn’t cross the line by revealing too much. Glanville could have followed their lead by leaving more to the imagination.Why was Glanville at the Oscars? She was walking the carpet before reporting for her job as a fashion -- yes, fashion -- correspondent for the OnTheRedCarpet.com.(Agencies)
