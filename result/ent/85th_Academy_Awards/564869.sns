Adele's "Skyfall" has won the Academy Award for best original song, a first for a James Bond theme.While 007 themes have long been a beloved movie tradition, they've never before won an Oscar. Three previous Bond tunes were nominated: "For Your Eyes Only," ''Nobody Does It Better," and "Live and Let Die."The Oscar extends Adele's award show dominance, leaving only an Emmy eluding her of the major American awards. She accepted the Oscar with producer Paul Epworth, with whom she wrote the lyrics and composed the music.Adele also performed "Skyfall" for the first time at the Sunday night ceremony.The other nominees were "Before My Time" from "Chasing Ice"; "Everybody Needs a Best Friend" from "Ted"; "Pi's Lullaby" from "Life of Pi"; and "Suddenly" from "Les Miserables."(Agencies)
