Sunday's Oscar ceremony has drawn the largest TV audience in three years as new host Seth MacFarlane helped to attract more young viewers.Nielsen ratings data showed 40.3 million Americans watched the 85th Academy Awards ceremony broadcast live on ABC, up 2 percent from last year when comedian Billy Crystal played the host. It was the most watched Oscars telecast in three years.The three-and-half-an-hour show was a real draw to young audience, as those between 18 and 34 years old grew 20 percent, the highest rating in that demographic since 2007.Among viewers aged 18-49, the most coveted group for advertisers, a 11 percent tick was reported.The academy has sought to regain the show's influence on TV in recent years. It has increased nominations for Best Picture award from five to between five and 10, and hired a pair of young hosts, Anne Hathaway and James Franco, to host the 83rd awards show.This year's new host MacFarlane has built a strong fan base among young viewers. He was the creator of an American animated sitcom "Family Guy" and helmsman on the comedy film "Ted" from the Dolby Theatre.TV critics generally praised MacFarlane's effort at the Sunday night show, although some found faults with the length of the performance and its lack of surprise.
