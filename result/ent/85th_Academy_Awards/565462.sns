The 85th Academy Awards ceremony was the most-watched entertainment telecast of the United States in the past three years.With 40.3 million viewers, ABC’s broadcast of the Academy Awards can be the most eye-catching entertainment program on TV in the recent three years, accounting for 3 percent of the total U.S. viewers.The possible reasons of this high audience rating is that the best picture contenders such as "Lincoln" and "Argo" had more box office than last year’s frontrunners like "The Artist".The host Seth MacFarlane may contribute to the ratings. He is the editor of top-rated animated TV shows "Family Guy" which is popular at Fox as well as NBC Universal. It made him a big success at reaching young-guy group.This was the second most popular Oscars telecast in the past decade, outdrawing the Golden Globe Awards by 20.6 million viewers and the Grammy Awards by 11.9 million viewers.And the most successful Oscars ceremony among young viewers was the show in 2004 which attracted 15.3 percent of U.S. viewers from 18 to 49 years old.(Agencies)
