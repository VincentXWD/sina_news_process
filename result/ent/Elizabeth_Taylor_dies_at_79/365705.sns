Two of the greatest legends of our time. One taken from us too soon, the other sharing her thoughts on a friend lost.Liza Minnelli has released a statement on the passing of the divine Elizabeth Taylor, expressing her sorrow over losing a fellow diva and sharing her love for the woman she used to call friend. Liza wrote:“She was a true star, because she not only had beauty and notoriety; Elizabeth Taylor had talent. As a friend she was always, always there for me. I'll miss her for the rest of my life, but I was so lucky to have known her.” Sad.So many people are going to miss her.
