Barbara Walters remembers Elizabeth Taylor

Barbara Walters was very fortunate to be friendly with Elizabeth Taylor in her lifetime and as a close friend, she appeared on Good Morning America to talk about the passing of the legend.She took time out to reflect on the many interviews the two shared over the years, but also to share that she had been in contact with Elizabeth not too long before her death today and she was convinced that "she might make it."We truly wish she had. So sad.
