In the small town of Concord, Massachusetts during the Civil War, the March sisters—Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth—live with their mother in a state of genteel poverty, their father having lost the family's fortune to an unscrupulous businessman several years earlier.  While Mr. March serves in the Union Army, Mrs. March, affectionately referred to as "Marmee" by her daughters, holds the family together and teaches the girls the importance of giving to those less fortunate than themselves, especially during the upcoming Christmas season.  Though the spoiled and vain Amy often bemoans the family's lack of material wealth and social status, Jo, an aspiring writer, keeps everyone entertained with her stories and plays, while the youngest March, the shy and sensitive Beth, accompanies Jo's productions on an out-of-tune piano.
