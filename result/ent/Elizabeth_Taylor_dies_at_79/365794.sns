In the town of Freehaven in Raintree County, Indiana, the high school class of 1859 poses for a photograph.  Everyone expects great things of valedictorian John Wickliff Shawnessyæ¢šn particular his sweetheart, Nell Gaither, who admires Johnny for his idealism, poetry and respect for truth and justice.Before graduation, Professor Jerusalem Webster Stiles, who smilingly describes himself as "pitiful and harmless," relates to his students a local legend.  Raintree County is named for a golden raintree, which was planted somewhere in the region by Johnny Appleseed.  Find it, declares the professor in an unusually pensive mood, and you will learn the secret of life itself.  Johnny immediately sets out to locate the tree, but as he wanders through a swamp, he nearly drowns.Back in town, Orville "Flash" Perkins boasts that, in addition to being "half horse, half alligator," he is the area's top runner.  Johnny challenges him to a race, and on the Fourth of July, the two competitors meet in the street.  Before the race, the men engage in a drinking contest, and although Johnny, who has never before drunk whiskey, is rendered nearly senseless, he nonetheless wins the race.Later that day, Johnny goes to the river for a picnic with the professor, an attractive married woman named Lydia Gray, and a beautiful visitor from the South named Susanna Drake.  Johnny and Susanna go swimming, and then, in a moment of passion, make love.  The next day, Susanna returns to New Orleans, and Johnny returns to Nell.
