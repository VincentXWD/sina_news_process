CAIRO, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Libyan rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) will legally represent Libya at the Arab League (AL) meeting of foreign ministers to be held on Saturday, said AL's Secretary General Nabil el-Arabi on Thursday.An AL official denied the pan-Arab body had recognized the NTC, saying a decision was taken to re-activate Libya's frozen membership, Egypt's official MENA news agency said.The source added the AL is a regional organization and not a state to recognize another.Earlier on Thursday, Egypt's state TV channel reported that the AL recognized the NTC as the representative of the Libyan people.On Feb. 22, the AL decided to freeze Libyan membership in the AL because of the violence in the country. In March, the organization decided to support a non-fly zone in Libya, which was regarded as a key step for the foreign intervention.After six months of confrontation, Libyan rebels have controlled most parts of the country and claimed Muammar Gaddafi's era is over. But the whereabouts of the Libyan leader remain unknown.
