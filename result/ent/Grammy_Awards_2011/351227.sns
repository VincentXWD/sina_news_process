Who was Grammy's most snubbed artist?

Music's biggest night is coming up, and Eminem, Bruno Mars and Lady Antebellum are leading the pack of nominees vying for Grammy gold on Feb. 13. But among the stars gushing over their honors – "It feels amazing!" crowed Best New Artist nominee Justin Bieber – there were a few glaring omissions. Which ones do you think were the biggest snubs? • Lady Gaga isn't up for Song of the Year or Record of the Year If the YouTube parodies of the video didn't clue you in, "Bad Romance" was arguably the biggest track of 2010. But although she has six nods, Gaga is shockingly absent in both categories (Song of the Year rewards the songwriter, Record of the Year rewards the artist, producer and mixer). • Ke$ha isn't up for anything Love her or hate her, you can't argue that her the singer behind the quadruple platinum single "Tik Tok" – and subsequent dance tracks like "Your Love Is My Drug" was a force to be reckoned with. Yet she was passed over in every single category. • Alicia Keys isn't up for Album of the Year Usually a Grammy favorite, Keys is nominated for "Empire State of Mind", her duet with Jay-Z. Yet Keys's fourth album, The Element of Freedom, was overlooked by the Grammys, in spite of its receiving almost universal praise from critics. • Sade isn't up for Album of the Year Like Keys, Sade's hotly anticipated Soldier of Love – her first album in a decade – was overlooked in spite of receiving praise almost across-the-board from music critics. • Train Isn't Up for Song of the Year or Record of the Year! "Hey, Soul Sister" was everywhere this year, from iPods (it's the 14th most downloaded song in history) to that oft-repeated Samsung commercial. Yet while a live version of the track is nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance by Duo or Group, the single is surprisingly M.I.A.
