2011-02-13 07:58:53 GMT
Only a fool would try to predict the Grammys. Luckily, I'm just the man for the job.Record of the YearNothin' on You, B.o.B feat. Bruno MarsLove the Way You Lie, Eminem feat. RihannaF--- You, Cee Lo GreenEmpire State of Mind, Jay-Z & Alicia KeysNeed You Now, Lady AntebellumShould Win: F--- You is deserving but too explicit for the big prize. Nothin' on You and Need You Now are second-tier. That leaves the two duets.Will Win: It could go either way, but my hunch is that Jay-Z and Alicia's star power will outshine Eminem & Rihanna.Album of the YearThe Suburbs, Arcade FireRecovery, EminemNeed You Now, Lady AntebellumThe Fame Monster, Lady GagaTeenage Dream, Katy PerryShould Win: If making an actual cohesive album counts for anything, this comes down to Arcade Fire and Eminem. As a Canuck, I'm for AC ...Will Win: ... But Eminem has the odds in his favour.Song of the YearBeg Steal Or Borrow, Ray LaMontagne & the Pariah DogsF--- You, Cee Lo GreenThe House That Built Me, Miranda LambertLove The Way You Lie, Eminem feat. RihannaNeed You Now, Lady AntebellumShould Win: Lambert or LaMontagne are long shots. Eminem and Lady Antebellum are better. But seriously, no song this year can match Cee Lo's outrageous kiss-off.Will Win: F--- You.New ArtistJustin BieberDrakeFlorence & the MachineMumford & SonsEsperanza SpaldingShould Win: Like any music lover, I'd prefer this went to jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding, British folkies Mumford & Sons or UK popsters Florence & the Machine. Which means ...Will Win: It's Bieber over Drake by the screams of a jillion teenage girls.Pop Vocal AlbumMy World 2.0, Justin BieberI Dreamed a Dream, Susan BoyleThe Fame Monster, Lady GagaBattle Studies, John MayerTeenage Dream, Katy PerryShould Win: Mayer tends to win song awards, Perry and Bieber are singles artists, and Boyle feels out of place here. The most logical choice is Gaga.Will Win: Gaga.Alternative Music AlbumThe Suburbs, Arcade FireInfinite Arms, Band of HorsesBrothers, The Black KeysBroken Bells, Broken BellsContra, Vampire WeekendShould Win: Black Keys have the hits, Broken Bells and Band of Horses the indie cred, and Vampire Weekend the pop smarts -- but Arcade Fire's Suburbs still seems a cut above.Will Win: Arcade Fire look like long shots in the main album category; this should be the consolation prize.Rock SongAngry World, Neil YoungLittle Lion Man, Mumford & SonsRadioactive, Kings of LeonResistance, MuseTighten Up, The Black KeysShould Win: KoL got their due last year, Muse are an album band, Young's done far better and, seriously do Mumford & Sons even qualify as rock? That leaves ...Will Win: Black Keys.Rock AlbumEmotion & Commotion, Jeff BeckThe Resistance, MuseBackspacer, Pearl JamMojo, Tom Petty & The HeartbreakersLe Noise, Neil YoungShould Win: With the exception of Beck's mediocre effort, most of the field is solid -- but Young's Le Noise and Muse's Resistance offer the biggest artistic risks and rewards.Will Win: Either, depending on voter age -- though Petty could also be a sentimental favourite with oldsters.Rap SongEmpire State of Mind, Jay-Z & Alicia KeysLove the Way You Lie, Eminem feat. RihannaNot Afraid, EminemNothin' on You, B.o.B & Bruno MarsOn to the Next One, Jay-Z & Swizz BeatzShould Win: Empire State and Way You Lie have the hooks, but Em's defiant Not Afraid packs the biggest emotional punch.Will Win: With Em splitting his own vote, Jay-Z & Alicia Keys should cruise to victory.Rap AlbumThe Adventures of Bobby Ray, B.o.BThank Me Later, DrakeRecovery, EminemThe Blueprint 3, Jay-ZHow I Got Over, The RootsShould Win: The Roots dropped one of their finest albums, but this will likely be a battle between Slim Shady and Hova. I'd vote for Jay ...Will Win: ... but I suspect the Academy will hand it to Slim Shady.Country AlbumUp on the Ridge, Dierks BentleyYou Get What You Give, Zac Brown BandThe Guitar Song, Jamey JohnsonNeed You Now, Lady AntebellumRevolution, Miranda LambertShould Win: Jamey Johnson's double-album Guitar Song earned him universal acclaim, but not much commercial success.Will Win: Lady Antebellum seem like the favourites in this category, but Lambert has been on a roll lately. She could easily steal this.
