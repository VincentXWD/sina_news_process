Flamboyant pop star Lady Gaga made her entrance to the Grammy Awards on Sunday encased in a giant egg, and declared that she was "in incubation" ahead of her performance at the ceremony.Gaga, 24, who is competing for six Grammy Awards, arrived on the red carpet inside an alien-like egg carried aloft by attendants dressed in gold. She could barely be seen inside it.It was the latest in a series of bizarre outfits from Lady Gaga, including a headline-grabbing dress made entirely of raw meat that she wore to the MTV Music Video Awards in September.In a Twitter message sent shortly after her red-carpet arrival, Lady Gaga said: "This is Nicola, Haus of Gaga: Gaga is in incubation. Tonight's performance is in collaboration with Hussein Chalayan and House of Mugler. X"Lady Gaga was expected to perform her new single "Born This Way" live on the Grammy stage later on Sunday.In a U.S. television interview aired on Sunday but recorded ahead of the Grammy ceremony, Gaga said there was always a point to her outrageous outfits."There's nothing that I've ever put on my body that I didn't understand where it came from, the reference of it, who inspired it. There's always some sort of a story or a concept that I'm telling," she told TV news show "60 Minutes".She also said she smokes marijuana and drinks whiskey when writing songs, but did not want to encourage her fans to do the same."(I) drink a lot of whiskey and I smoke weed when I write. And I don't do it a lot because it's not good for my voice."I don't want to encourage kids to do drugs....And I don't lie. I'm not a liar. I built good will with my fans. They know who I am. And I'm just like them in so many ways," she added.The singer, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, picked up two Grammys for her hit "Bad Romance" during a ceremony preceding the main telecast on Sunday but was not on hand to accept the trophy.(Agencies)
