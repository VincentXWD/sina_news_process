Neil Young wins first Grammy for music

A year after he won the first Grammy of his career, eclectic rocker Neil Young doubled his tally on Sunday.The win marked the first recognition for his musical abilities, since last year's honor was for his work as an art director on the packaging of a boxed set.This time he won a statuette in the best rock song category for "Angry World," a tune from his album "Le Noise.""This is my first Grammy for music, and it's appreciated greatly," Young said.He lost another race to Paul McCartney, and remains in contention for best rock album.Young, now 65, is frequently nominated -- 11 times since 2006 alone -- but his musicianship evidently was not compelling enough for Grammy voters, who now number about 12,000 music industry professionals.Young, in turn, has made no secret of his disdain for the Grammys, declaring that he was "not Grammy material" in a 1987 interview recounted in the authorized biography "Shakey." But his appearance at both this year's and last year's events appears to indicate a softening of his attitude.The Canadian singer-songwriter has confounded fans over the past 40 years with an idiosyncratic output spanning folk, rock, grunge, soul and country. "Le Noise," his 31st studio release since 1969, debuted at No. 2 on the Canadian albums chart and at No. 14 in the United States.(Agencies)
