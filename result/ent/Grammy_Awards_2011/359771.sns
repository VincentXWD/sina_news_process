The view from inside Grammys

Here's what was seen from inside the audience at Sunday's 53rd annual Grammy Awards:___There's a whole lotta love inside the Staples Center on this Valentine's Day Eve. Cyndi Lauper is on her feet cheering and clapping throughout Janelle Monae's crowd-surfing performance. Then a man in the nosebleed section professed his love for Paramore's leading lady, Hayley Williams, as she presented the best rock album award to Muse. "I LOVE YOU, HAILEY!" he screamed.____Would Grammy winner Eminem wear a Grammy baseball cap? For those attendees who want to remember their experience with a memento, souvenirs are for sale in the Staples Center lobby, including graphic T-shirts ranging from $25 to $35, baseball caps and posters for $20 and commemorative pins for $5. The cheapest keepsake? The official Grammy Awards program. It's free.___The floor must be extra slippery tonight. Christina Aguilera took a quick spill at the end of the Aretha Franklin tribute and one of Muse's rebels experienced a faceplant while rushing up the steps from the audience. Nicole Kidman managed to stay on her feet though. She was walking back to her seat as those freaky Muse characters were running past her. Kidman couldn't help but laugh.___The stage and crowd pits are split into two sides to accommodate the plethora of performers, so when Lady Gaga wails "Born This Way" on the left side of the stage, the crowd in front of her goes crazy but those on the right are decidedly less thrilled. They can't even glimpse her pounding on that out-of-this-word organ.___Justin Bieber's samurai drummers are very method. Even when the cameras move away from the beatmakers, they continue to march out of the arena in time. Bieber himself used ninja-like moves to slip in and out of two costume changes.___Lady Gaga didn't just whip her ponytail while dancing on stage. She was also shaking it in the audience when she stopped to say hello to Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith before sitting down in front of them â€” and again when winning the best pop vocal album award.___Lady Gaga is back in her seat in time for Katy Perry's performance. She gabs with the Smith clan again, perhaps apologizing for blocking their view with her floppy black hat, which doesn't catch any heart-shaped confetti in its bill at the end of Perry's performance. That's because all the confetti drifts backstage away from the crowd.___After the rollicking performance from Bob Dylan and company, chaos erupts on stage in preparation for a series of upcoming performances. On one side, Vegas-style lights are rapidly being erected during a commercial break while fake rocks are being wheeled onto the other side. In the center, the members of Lady Antebellum sit on the illuminated steps and enjoy a few moments of calm before launching into their medley.___If there was an award for most energetic performance during a Grammy show Cee Lo Green would surely be in the running. Before he even starts singing, scads of audience members are already on their feet shaking their feathers. By the end of the performance, Green, Gynthew Paltrow and their puppet pals have this Grammy audience in the palm of their hands.___During yet another break, Rihanna is led through the audience to the center stage with multiple crew members carrying a massive train behind her. She flaps her arms as Pink croons "Glitter in the Air" in the background. Pink's sprinkly, acrobatic performance from last year was playing on the giant monitors inside the arena instead of the commercials that people at home were stuck watching on their TVs.___Arcade Fire's Win Butler tells the crowd to head for the exits as the album-of-the-year winners stick around onstage to play one last song. But many in the audience, including CBS head honcho Les Moonves and his wife, Julie Chen, are way ahead of him. They began their dash for the exit before the final award was even handed out. Those who did stick around see Arcade Fire play an encore then pass out equipment to stragglers. Microphones are popular. Their stands are not.(Agencies)
