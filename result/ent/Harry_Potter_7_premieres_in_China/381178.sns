LOS ANGELES, July 16 (Xinhua) -- "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2" has opened by posting the biggest single-day gross in history, scaring up "an almost unimaginable" 92.1 million U.S. dollars, according to figures released Saturday.The film, the final installment in the boy wizard franchise, made its debut Friday night in 4,375 theaters across North America and immediately took the single-day crown of all time from "The Twilight Saga: New Moon," which garnered 72.7 million dollars on its first day two years ago, Hollywood.Com Box-Office reported.The 92.1-million-dollar North America tally, which covers U.S. and Canadian box office, included a record-breaking 43.5 million dollars for midnight screenings.In the international market, the Harry Potter finalist earned another 75 million dollars on its first day at the box office.If the current pace persists through the weekend, Hollywood.Com Box-Office predicted, the swan-song picture of the highly popular storyline would beat out "The Dark Knight," which took in 158 million dollars the weekend it debuted three years ago.The seven previous installments of Harry Potter franchise have grossed 6.4 billion dollars worldwide, the most successful series of all time.Elsewhere at the Friday box office, Disney Animation Studios' "Winnie the Pooh" was off to a solid start, grossing 2.9 million dollars.
