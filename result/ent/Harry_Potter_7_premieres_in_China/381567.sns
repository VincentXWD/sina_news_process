As usual, "Harry's" box office magic got a little wizardly assist from ticket-price inflation and pricey 3-D admissions."Transformers: Dark of the Moon" continued to pummel international audiences into submission in its third weekend of release. After dominating the chart for two weeks, Michael Bay's destruction derby remans an overseas favorite, adding another $39 million in nearly 9,300 locations in 59 territories. This brings the cumulative international total to $460 million and its worldwide revenue within stomping distance of $800 million."Cars 2" took the weekend's international checkered flag in third place with $12.4 million in 28 territories and an overseas total of $146.6 million and a global total of $311.9 million after a month in release.Here are the top 10 movies at international theaters this past weekend, followed by distributor, international gross for the weekend (excluding North America), worldwide gross to date (including North America), and number of weeks in domestic release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak and provided by Hollywood.com:1.
