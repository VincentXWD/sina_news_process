LOS ANGELES â€” "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" crossed the $800 million mark worldwide this weekend after just 10 days of release and in the process, catapults the franchise total to over $7 billion globally. Topping the international chart for the second straight weekend with an estimated $121.3 million, "Potter-Mania" is in full swing with foreign audiences and shows no signs of a letup."Transformers: Dark of the Moon" had another crushing weekend overseas, drawing $62 million in its fourth week of release at 12,554 locations in 60 territories. The movie opened in China this past weekend, where it posted the all-time biggest debut by an American film with $40 million, and its global total is flirting with a massive $900 million.Completing a three-peat of last week's international lineup is "Cars 2," which lapped the animated competition with $17.7 million in 31 territories and a global total of $350.1 million in its fifth weekend."Captain America: The First Avenger" earned only $2.8 million overseas in its first weekend out, but that's because it only opened in Italy. It will debut in 23 additional territories next weekend, including the U.K., Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and South Korea.Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios gave distributors around the world the option of shortening the title to simply "The First Avenger," out of concern about anti-American sentiment. But the only countries that took them up on it were Russia, Ukraine and South Korea.Here are the top 10 movies at international theaters this past weekend, followed by distributor, estimated international gross for the weekend (excluding North America), worldwide gross to date (including North America), and number of weeks in domestic release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak and provided by Hollywood.com:1.
