Kate Middleton became a fashion phenomenon even before she wed her Prince. Kate's Wardrobe was set up in 2010, borne out of my own interest in the so-called 'Kate Effect'.Princess Diana wore an elegant pink gown to the opera in Milan in 1985. Kate Middleton chose the same color halter dress for a Starlight Children's Foundation event in 2008.
