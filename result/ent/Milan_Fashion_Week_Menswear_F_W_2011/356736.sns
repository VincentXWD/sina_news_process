Greys and blacks dominated the catwalks Tuesday as Giorgio Armani, DSquared2 and Neil Barrett wound up the fourth and last day of the Milan's men fashion shows for autumn-winter 2011-2012.Armani presented grey in all its incarnations -- stone coal, blue-grey, greyish-green, with jackets with strong shoulders and clean silhouettes.Overcoats and fur-lined leather coats, coloured shirts in violet, pink and orange, and buckskin shoes rounded out the collection.As was to be expected, the twin stylists of DSquared2 put on a spectacular show, complete with a "Little House on the Prairie"-style covered wagon.The Wild West atmosphere was reflected in the mainly black clothes, with black Wyatt Earp hats and leather braces.The duo's jackets were very long and tied at the waist with a belt, or very short and hyper-cinched.Jeans were worn low on the waist, while for nights out there were little waistcoats with khaki on the front and tartan in the back.In terms of materials, flannel, wool and leather dominated.The same limited palette of black, white, grey and deep navy blue were seen at the Neil Barrett show, which featured comfortable and luxurious materials, like cashmere and fur, but also less-classic materials like neoprene.(Agencies)
