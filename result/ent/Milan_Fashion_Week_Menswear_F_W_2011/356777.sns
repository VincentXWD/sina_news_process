MILAN - AT PRADA no season is like the one before.Although her trademark style is minimalist, Miuccia Prada has more fashion ideas than the patterns of a kaleidoscope.Her latest menswear collection presented on Sunday introduces a very young customer who likes his coats wide, his pants narrow and his shirts and sweaters shiny. He carries old-fashioned boxy luggage and wears thick-soled leather running shoes. His hair is schoolboy short and his face cleanly shaven.In the trouser department, the novelty comes in cropped styles including knickerbockers worn with colourful knee socks. When it comes to knitwear, Prada ups the ante offering minimalist styles in sparkling lurex. Silk shirts primly buttoned at the neck and worn without a tie in purple and blue are as shimmery as that of a circus juggler.Although she keeps to her staple grey and black palette for most suits and jackets, the designer introduces snow white leather for next winter's coats and boots.Prada also sped up the pace of her once languid shows, with fast track rock music and a brand new stage design. Models marched briskly up and down the metal staircase, which divided the theatre into two seating levels and two runways. (Agencies)
