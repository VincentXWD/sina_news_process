Milan Fashion Week: Jimmy Choo for Men
2011-01-20 14:38:09 GMT
Dudes can have their Choos, too. Tamara Mellon, the creative director of Jimmy Choo, introduced the company’s new collection for men here in Milan. Which is as good a time as any to introduce a new man of ours, Richard Haines, a dapper illustrator-about-town who will be artfully interpreting looks and items that catch our eye during our fashion travels over the next few weeks. In an age of ubiquitous street photography and all-access passes to anything and everything fashion-related, it’s a good moment to step back and take a look at things with bit less precision and a little more, well, romance.Now, back to Choo. While there were certainly the expected statement shoes, like the descriptively R-rated “porno paisley” brocade evening slippers and lace-ups in electric purple and leopard, the predominant, and nicely surprising, aesthetic was one of restrained elegance. Refined monk-strapped shoes in beautiful matte black leather, shearling-lined biker boots and sleek Chelsea boots in a range of rich neutral colors ruled the range. The flashiest of the bunch were the sneaker styles, both low and high top, in a multitude of bright colors and showy prints. Yet these too came in quieter all-black versions and in a gray-flannel high-top lined in sheepskin. The tonal rubber soles, with “Jimmy Choo” subtly molded onto them, will certainly leave their mark.
