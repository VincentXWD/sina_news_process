Queen Elizabeth II was missing her husband Prince Philip, her stalwart companion throughout her 60-year reign, who was recuperating in hospital Tuesday as she rounded off her diamond jubilee.Their youngest child Prince Edward visited him in hospital on Tuesday, and said he was "getting better" after contracting a bladder infection, while the queen was bearing up without him.The Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving royal consort in British history, was taken to the King Edward VII Hospital in London on Monday and is likely to remain there for several days. He will be 91 on Sunday."He's feeling a lot better. I think just a good rest is probably required," Edward said as he left the hospital.Asked if the duke had been keeping up with the jubilee celebrations, he said: "He's been watching it all on television."When asked how the 86-year-old queen was doing without him, he said: "She's bearing up but missing him, obviously."Thank you very much for your concern, it's much appreciated," he added.Edward's wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, added: "He's in good spirits, he's on good form."Prince Philip has been a constant companion to the queen throughout her reign, and his illness cast a shadow over Tuesday's jubilee finale: a service of thanksgiving, a carriage procession and an appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.The queen travelled to the service at St Paul's Cathedral with one of her ladies-in-waiting, and cut a solitary figure as she walked on her own through the landmark church.Prayers were said for the duke during the service.In his father's absence, heir Prince Charles and his wife Camilla joined the queen in her carriage as they waved to the crowd of 1.5 million who lined their route from the Houses of Parliament to Buckingham Palace.The palace balcony seemed poignantly emptier than on previous occasions as the royal family waved to the crowds.And in her diamond jubilee address later Tuesday, the queen mentioned her husband, but not his absence."Prince Philip and I want to take this opportunity to offer our special thanks and appreciation to all those who have had a hand in organising these jubilee celebrations," she said.Prime Minister David Cameron reflected the national thoughts for Prince Philip."Everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know that (the Duke) is going to be OK," he told Sky News television.At a jubilee pop concert in London on Monday night, which the queen insisted on attending without him, Prince Philip won cheers and shouts from the crowds after Charles said: "The only sad thing about this evening is that my father cannot be here with us because unfortunately he's been taken unwell."Ladies and gentlemen, if we shout loud enough he might just hear us in hospital."The crowd chanted "Philip! Philip!"Newspapers questioned whether Sunday's Thames river pageant -- four hours standing on a boat in chilly temperatures -- might have been too much for the ageing prince, who needed a heart procedure six months ago.However, he appeared to enjoy being on the water, pointing out sights of interest and laughing with the younger royals.Born a prince of Greece and Denmark, he gave up his promising career as an officer in Britain's royal navy when his wife acceded to the throne in 1952. They were visiting Kenya at the time and he broke the news."He has been a constant strength and guide," the queen told parliament in March.Forthright and outspoken, he has a reputation for off-colour jokes, while behind the scenes he is said to be the family's patriarch and a key support to the monarch.The prince said last year he wanted to scale down his royal duties as his 90th birthday loomed and in December he suffered chest pains and was treated for a blocked coronary artery.(Agencies)
