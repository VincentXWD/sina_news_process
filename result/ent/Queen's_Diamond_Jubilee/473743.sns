David and Victoria Beckham made a special video to congratulate Queen Elizabeth on her Diamond Jubilee.The soccer star and his fashion designer wife – who are close friends with the royals and attended Prince William’s wedding last year – appeared in a tribute piece on the BBC to pass on their congratulations on her 60-year-reign.David, looking dapper in a dark suit and white shirt, spoke on behalf of the couple, who were seated side by side on matching chairs.David said: ‘I’d just like to say from us, me, Victoria, our family and the entire country, congratulations Your Majesty.’With a slight smile on her face, Victoria – who wore an orange halterneck dress with her hair in a fashionable side plait – let her husband do the talking.The Beckham’s relationship with the royal family goes back years.When Victoria was a member of chart topping group The Spice Girls in 1997, they famously met the monarch following their appearance in the Royal Variety Performance at the London PalladiumDavid and William - who is president of the English Football Association - became close after leading England's failed bid to host the 2018 soccer World Cup, resulting in an invitation to attend the royal wedding at Westminster Abbey last year.David, 37, received an Order of the British Empire (OBE) from Queen Elizabeth in 2003 and previously revealed she had shocked him by knowing details of his personal life when they met at a dinner for President Barack Obama's visit to London last year.
