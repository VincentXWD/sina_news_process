The Queen's dynasty is secured

To become a grandparent is an awe-inspiring experience. It gives you the feeling of a future being guaranteed. I should know: I have six grandchildren, and I am only 62! Someone who is a grandparent can say to themselves: ‘I shall die — as shall we all — but I have handed on the baton. The story goes on.’How much more must this be the case with the birth of a great-grandchild. And with a royal great-grandchild, the feelings are shared by everyone who has an interest in the future of the Monarchy and of our country.The great-grandmother in this story has not been a passive observer. Now the Duchess of Cambridge has had her son, the Queen will know that she has secured her dynasty, and the Monarchy, up to three generations into the future — perhaps into the 22nd century.This is not something purely accidental. It was not bound to happen. It is something in which, discreetly, the Queen has been more involved than many people would think.Only a few decades ago in Britain, the public was in republican mood. The Press could be blamed for some of the bad taste with which it reported stories, but it could not be blamed for the stories themselves — of royal marriages breaking up at the rate of plates in a Greek restaurant, amid a political climate in which the very idea of monarchy was looking questionable.The Queen is the person who has steered the Monarchy out of the troubled waters. She has been able to do so in part because she obviously gets on so well with Prince William, her grandchild, with whom — since the death of his mother — she has had a particularly warm relationship.The Queen is a modest person. She does not think that the House of Windsor is the best family in Britain: it is a representative family. Just as the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey represents all the fallen in war, so the Royal Family represents all families.Thousands flocked to Buckingham Palace this week for news of the royal birth, just as millions swarmed into the Mall during the two Royal Jubilees to thank the Queen for getting it so very right.The future is safe — thanks to her.
