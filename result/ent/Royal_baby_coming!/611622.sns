The world was awaiting the first glimpse of Britain's new prince on Tuesday, with camera crews poised to photograph Prince William and his wife, Kate, leaving a London hospital with their baby son.Kate, 31, gave birth to the couple's first child, who is third in line to the British throne, on Monday afternoon, ending weeks of feverish anticipation about the arrival.The baby's name will be announced later but George and James, both traditional royal names, were favored choices with British bookmakers for the child, who is destined to be king.The popular couple were expected to adhere to tradition by giving the public the first sight of the royal baby on the steps as they leave St Mary's Hospital in west London.Kensington Palace announced the arrival of the boy, weighing 3.8 kilograms at about 8:30 pm, on Monday, four hours after the baby's birth, saying Kate and her child were doing well and would remain in hospital overnight.Congratulations flooded in from around the world after the announcement of the birth, which was followed moment-by-moment by global media as well as the British press, with the excitement seen as a boost for Britons facing economic austerity.British tabloid newspaper the Sun temporarily renamed itself the Son in honor of the baby.The birth fuels a new wave of popularity for the House of Windsor.Support for the royals dipped after Princess Diana's death in a car crash in Paris in 1997, a year after her divorce from Prince Charles, as the royals were accused of being out of touch with modern Britain over their handling of the aftermath.But last year's celebrations of Queen Elizabeth's 60th year on the throne showed support for the monarchy was running at a record high.Roger Mortimore, a professor of public opinion and political analysis with the Institute of Contemporary British History at King's College London, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the popularity of the monarchy is very much bound up with Britain's sense of national identity."Most of us value and are proud of Britain's history and past role in the world, and maintaining as much of our traditions as possible is a part of that and helps us to feel a continued connection with our national past," he said.Not all Britons were celebrating the news however, with Britain's small Republican movement saying it was wrong the future head of state should be chosen by birth."It's sad to hear monarchists do down our country, saying we can't be equal, we can't be democratic. We aspire to something better," the campaign group Republic tweeted.In China, the royal baby's birth was among the 10 most discussed topics on Sina Weibo, the country's largest microblogging site, on Tuesday.Web users left congratulatory posts under Weibo threads by British ambassador to China Sebastian Wood and the embassy.Some media outlets made charts about the British royal family tree to help readers learn about the order of succession to the throne.
