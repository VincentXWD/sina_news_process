The uber talented singer has just been announced as one of the acts set to perform at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in February. Taylor joins a list that includes Nicki Minaj, Bruno Mars, Jason Aldean, Kelly Clarkson and the Foo Fighters. Taylor already has four Grammys to her name, but come next month she could be adding three more to collection. Taylor is nominated for Best Country Solo Performance, Best Country song for "Mean," and Best Country Album for "Speak Now." What song are you hoping Taylor performs on Grammy night? Maybe she'll hit the stage with the Civil Wars to perform Safe and Sound from the Hunger Games soundtrack.
