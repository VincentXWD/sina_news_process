9:25 p.m. ET: The Grammy crowd appears to be feeling the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations.” It’s their first live performance in more than two decades.9:20 p.m. ET: Foster the People look like throwbacks of the Beach Boys strumming to “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.”9:03 p.m. ET: Was Chris Martin’s pitch off? He sounded like he was going through puberty for a while there.8:59 p.m. ET: Lady Gaga didn’t walk the red carpet, but even in the crowd, her black, high fashion, funeral appropriate outfit stands out. Especially when she appears to be trying to nuzzle with Paul McCartney.8:56 p.m. ET: Rihanna starts off her set with Coldplay with “We Found Love,” crawling on the floor, fireworks on a screen behind her. Club beat begins and she strips off her shirt.8:45 p.m. ET: The Foo Fighters have won four Grammy awards tonight and yet they’re not on the main stage. Go figure.8:36 p.m. ET: Jay-Z and Kayne West win best rap performance for “Otis” but neither are at the Grammys to pick up the award. New baby/fashion week obligations?8:25 p.m. ET: Chris Brown’s wearing a Letterman jacket and dancing/hopping over boxes, mimicking Michael Jackson. Compared to his MTV VMA performance last year, it’s subdued, but still great. He doesn’t say a thing to the crowd — salutes and walks off.8:24 p.m. ET: Adele wins the first Grammy of the telecast, best pop solo performance for “Someone Like You.” “I need to thank my doctors I suppose, who brought my voice back,” she says.8:20 p.m. ET: Alicia Keys and Bonnie Rait are paying tribute to the late Etta James with “A Sunday Kind of Love.” Before starting up the piano, Keys announced, “We love Whitney Houston.”8:13 p.m. ET: Bruno Mars, during his performance, says he’s paying tribute to the “beautiful Whitney.” Odds are, everyone on stage will mention her at some point.8:10 p.m. ET: After a medley of Houston clips, LL says, “This night is about healing” — through music.8:05 p.m. ET: Host LL Cool J begins by leading the crowd in a prayer: “Tonight, we ask ourselves: How do we speak to this time, to this day? There is no way around this. We’ve had a death in our family. At least for me, for me, the only thing that feels right is to begin with a prayer. For a woman that we loved, for our fallen sister, Whitney Houston.”8:00 p.m. ET: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band kick off the official ceremony with “We Take Care of Our Own.”7:35 p.m. ET: If Rihanna is nervous about the prospect of being in the same stadium as her ex, Chris Brown, she isn’t showing it. She’s breezy talking to E! on the red carpet, dressed in very low cut (on both sides), black Armani gown. Her birthday’s coming up, and she’ll “be in London, doing the Ritz.”7:23 p.m. ET: Nicki Minaj has arrived with … a bishop. She’s wearing a large, red cape type thing. With a hood. Gaga, eat your heart out.7:10 p.m. ET: Second (maybe) to Hudson’s Houston tribute, Adele’s performance is the most anticipated moment of the Grammys. E! heard the singer, fresh from vocal chord surgery, during rehearsals. They said she sounded spectacular.6:41 p.m. ET: On the E! red carpet, Kelly Rowland reiterates what many have said leading up to tonight’s ceremony: “It’s a very somber tone, tonight at the Grammys. We’ve lost our hero.”6:39 p.m. ET: R&B singer Kelly Price was the last person to sing with Houston. They did an imprompteau duet at a Thursday pre-Grammy party in Hollywood. “I wasn’t expecting her to sing, I wasn’t going to ask her to do that,” Price tells E!’s Ryan Seacrest. “She walked up on the stage and said give me the mike. So I gave her the mike. And I walked up on the stage and sang with her.” On Houston’s death, Price says, “In my heart, I was praying it was an Internet hoax. … To realize that it wasn’t, I don’t even know how to explain it.”6:38 p.m. ET: It’s going to be a somber celebration at the Grammys tonight. One day after Whitney Houston’s sudden and untimely death, stars are hitting the red carpet and no one can stop talking about their memories of her. She’ll also be a big part of tonight’s show — Jennifer Hudson is slated to perform Houston’s 1992 hit “I Will Always Love You.”Watch ”The Death of Whitney Houston,” a special edition of ”Good Morning America” Monday at 7 a.m. ET, featuring special coverage about Whitney Houston’s life and death
