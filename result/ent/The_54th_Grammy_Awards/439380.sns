"E.T." kicked off Katy Perry's triumphant return to the spotlight when she took the stage at the 2012 Grammy Awards Sunday (February 12). But the singer soon transitioned the spacey Teenage Dream track into a brand-new song, clearly referencing her breakup from Russell Brand as she sassily kissed off her heartbreak while she performed on TV for the first time since the split.Wearing her now-signature blue hair and a body-hugging silver bodysuit, Perry was unapologetic about her negative feelings about a certain former love in the new single "Part of Me." "You chew me up and spit me up," she sang. "You took my life/ You drained me down/ But that was then, and this is now."As the track circled its way to its scathing chorus, she proclaimed, "Look at me/ This is the part of me that you're never ever going to take away from me."During the empowerment anthem, Perry makes some more references to a broken love affair that burned bright and burned out even harder. "I feel deep," she sang. "You let me drown." But, as the song continued, Perry proclaims her triumph over the guy who broke her heart as she sings, "Look at me/ I'm sparkling/ You will never put me out again/ So you can keep the diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway.""Part of Me" officially drops on February 21. At the Grammy Awards, Perry was up for two prizes, including Best Pop Solo Performance and Record of the Year for "Firework." "Part of Me" is the lead single off Perry's forthcoming Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which will be released on March 27.Perry graced the Grammy Awards red carpet in a sparkling, baby blue gown designed by Elie Saab. Before the Grammy Awards, Perry's hair colorist, Rita Hazan, shared that she secretly wished that she would match her hair to her dress. "I feel like she's going to rock the blue and find a dress to match the hair, which I absolutely love about her," Hazan dished.Stick with MTV News for all the news on Whitney Houston's tribute, the Grammy red-carpet fashion, Grammy winners and more until the hangover wears off!
