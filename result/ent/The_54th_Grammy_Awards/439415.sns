One of the Grammy show's most poignant moments was one that TV viewers didn't see.When Tony Bennett received the Grammy Sunday for best pop performance by a duo or group for his duet with Amy Winehouse, he invited the late singer's parents to join him on stage during the awards ceremony's pre-show segment."We shouldn't be here. Our darling daughter should be here," Winehouse's father, Mitch, said after he and the singer's mother, Janis, had embraced Bennett.His daughter was thrilled, Winehouse said, to have recorded the Grammy-winning song "Body and Soul" with Bennett.Mitch Winehouse also noted Whitney Houston's death Saturday and the recent passing of Etta James."What can I say? There's a beautiful girl band up in heaven," he said.
