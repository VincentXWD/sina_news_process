LOS ANGELES  — Emmy winners — and even losers — won't be seeing red at this year's Governors Ball.That's  because Sunday's official after-party for the 63rd annual Primetime  Emmy Awards will be almost entirely decked out with black and white  decor.The behemoth  57,600-square-foot space inside the West Hall of the Los Angeles  Convention Center has been transformed into a two-tone haven for the  dinner party."This year's decor  theme — mod illusions — will take guests on a trip of various  movements, multiple sensations and figments of the imagination," said  Shelia Manning, a casting director and co-chairwoman of the Governors  Ball. "The eye will continually be tricked and deceived throughout the  evening of black and white with a touch of gold — the Emmy."The  party's glittering chandeliers will rise and fall above the 3,600  invitees throughout the evening. About 1,200 servers with temporary  facial tattoos will supply drinks and hors d'oeuvres, while 42 "living  art" performers and aerial artists amuse guests.The ceremony  across the street at the Nokia Theatre will be broadcast in black and  white on large spheres hovering over the space.For dinner,  attendees will feast on an heirloom tomato salad sandwiched between  grilled asparagus and fried gold potatoes, filet mignon accompanied by  baby carrots, cipollini onions and white-cheddar macaroni gratin. For  dessert: a milk chocolate brownie, blackberry macarons and chocolate  rice crisps with chocolate blackberry cream and honey sauce.During  a preview event Wednesday, attendees received their own airbrushed  facial tattoos, noshed on samples of this year's Governors Ball menu and  sipped The Emmy, a cocktail made with orange-flavored vodka, grapefruit  juice, agave syrup and ginger ale. They also received the same party  favor that ball-goers will take home Sunday night: a box of cake pops.(Agencies)
