LOS ANGELES  — Jane Lynch  didn't trip over the red carpet while rolling it out Wednesday morning  in anticipation of Sunday's Emmy ceremony. Despite not seeing "daylight  in a couple of days" and dreaming she might experience a "face plant" as  the show's host, Lynch pulled it off without a hitch."I  don't even know where I am anymore," she joked to dozens of  photographers and reporters who gathered for the unveiling with the  show's executive producer Mark Burnett and TV academy chairman John  Shaffner.For the fourth year,  the show will be held at the Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. The  390-foot red carpet — more like a red sidewalk, really — will canvass  the entire plaza across the street from the Staples Center.After the show, Shaffner said the red carpet and the solar panels powering it will be donated to local charities."People will get to live on red carpet," he boasted.Lynch  teased that the 63rd annual Primetime Emmys would feature an appearance  by such members of MTV's "Jersey Shore" gang as Nicole "Snooki"  Polizzi, Paul "DJ Pauly D" Delvecchio and Mike "The Situation"  Sorrentino.She said the show will also star a chorus of singing  TV actors who will introduce the award categories. They might  melodically move the show along, too."If any of our winners go long, they'll be gently singing them off," promised Lynch.Inside  the Nokia Theatre, the sweeping set was coming together. On one side of  the stage, an enormous Emmy statue was showered in glittering charms.  On the other side, a raised platform was surrounded by multiple screens.  At the center was a voluminous circular screen doubling as an entryway."It's  a very big stage at the Nokia," said Burnett. "It feels important. I  like the colors — reds and golds, warm tones that make you feel invited  and positive. Then, you drop in great musical moments and fun. That's  the tone and pace. There's too much to fit in."Does that mean the show will go over its three-hour running time? "Hey, has it ever not?"Place  cards on the chairs in front of the stage's black-and-gold stairs  illustrated that Hugh Laurie, Betty White and Chris Colfer will have the  best seats in the house: front-row center.Other  nominees with sweet front-row seat assignments included Jon Cryer,  Steve Carell, Mariska Hargitay, Connie Britton, Kyle Chandler, Amy  Poehler and Will Arnett.
