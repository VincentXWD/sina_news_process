LOS ANGELES â€” Charlie Sheen turned a surprise appearance on the Emmys into a platform to offer his blessing to his old series.He was on hand Sunday night as presenter of Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, which he wryly described as "my old category."But the actor, who had a rancorous parting last season from "Two and a Half Men," took a moment before reading the nominees to wish his former series well."From the bottom of my heart," he said, "I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you will continue to make great television."On Monday, the new season begins with Ashton Kutcher replacing Sheen in the CBS hit.(Agencies)
