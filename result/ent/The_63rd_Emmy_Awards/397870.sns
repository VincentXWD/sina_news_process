LOS ANGELES â€” Kate Winslet had barely collected the first Emmy of a distinguished career when she was asked about her real-life role as a life saver.The British actress sprang into action in August when she helped rescue Richard Branson's 90-year-old mother from a fire that destroyed his Caribbean home, where Winslet was a guest with her two young children."I so knew I was going to get questions about the fire," she said, laughing backstage at Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards."I was in the right place at the right time to help Eve out of the house," Winslet said about Branson's mother. "In truth I will say she was already out of her bedroom. She had made it that far and I was just there to speed things along because we had to get out quickly. Thank God we were all OK."Winslet won an Emmy as lead actress in a miniseries or a movie for HBO's "Mildred Pierce." It gives her another shiny gold statuette to go with the Oscar she won for "Shakespeare in Love."(Agencies)
