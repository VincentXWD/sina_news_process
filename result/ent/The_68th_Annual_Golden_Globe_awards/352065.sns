The Golden Globe nominations in television categories had a familiar feel.Fox's "Glee," which won best comedy or musical in its freshman year, topped all other shows with five nominations and could win best show honors for its sophomore season, too. The show's Matthew Morrison, Lea Michele, Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch all earned nominations for their acting.ABC's "Modern Family" won an Emmy as best new comedy a few months ago and was nominated for a Golden Globe, too. Sofia Vergara and Eric Stonestreet were nominated in supporting actor categories.All the TV series and actors who picked up trophies at the Golden Globes ceremony last winter have a chance to do so again in January, according to the nominations announced in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Tuesday.The tiny AMC network beat all its rivals with two nominations for best drama series: "Mad Men," which has won this category three years in a row; and this year's zombie sensation "The Walking Dead." Other top drama nominees were Showtime's "Dexter," HBO's new "Boardwalk Empire" and CBS' "The Good Wife."Besides "Glee" and "Modern Family," best comedy nominees included "The Big C" and "Nurse Jackie" from Showtime, NBC's "30 Rock" and CBS' "The Big Bang Theory." Two actors in their final years with series — Steve Carell on NBC's "The Office" and Kyra Sedgwick of TNT's "The Closer" — both received Golden Globe nominations.HBO's "Temple Grandin" and Starz's "Pillars of the Earth" were the most honored productions in the miniseries or movie category, with three nominations each. They were nominated for best movie or miniseries, along with HBO's "The Pacific" and "You Don't Know Jack," and "Carlos" from the Sundance Channel.HBO led the way with 12 nominations, showing particular strength in the movie and miniseries categories that are largely left to the cable networks now. Although its acclaimed "Treme" series was snubbed, the Jersey epic "Boardwalk Empire" was noticed both as a potential series winner and a vehicle for star Steve Buscemi.Al Pacino, Judi Dench, Dennis Quaid, Claire Danes, Ian McShane and Jennifer Love Hewitt are among the well-known actors with Golden Globes nominations for movies or miniseries.Dramas made by broadcast networks were largely overlooked in the nominations. Last year's winner, Julianna Margulies in "The Good Wife," and Hugh Laurie of Fox's "House" were the only two actors in broadcast dramas among the 10 nominees in their acting categories.(Agencies)
