Ten days and counting until the 68th Golden Globe Awards show (January 16th on NBC). And yes, we do wonder what Matt Damon will say when he presents the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Robert De Niro. And we do care which designer dress that Matt's fellow presenter Scarlett Johansson will have chosen for the red carpet. But what we really wanted to know is: What will the stars be eating at the Golden Globes dinner?So we got the early dish from Chef Katsuo "Suki" Sugiura at the Bevery Hilton (the hotel that's played host to the Globes 40 times over). With nearly 1,300 guests to feed during the live telecast (jaded eaters, all), here's what Chef Sugiura has up his sleeve for host Ricky Gervais, and nominees ranging from Nicole Kidman to Colin Firth.Seated at dinner tables topped with vases of antique gold- and rust-toned roses designed by Mark Held, the glitterati wiill start with appetizers that are veggie forward:Grilled Eggplant with Edamame and Red Pepper Hummus with Marinated Artichoke and Arugula.Then, an entrée combo with a nod to the Central Valley, where much of California produce is raised. They're bold, Black Swan bold:Grilled Beef Tenderloin of Beef with Caramelized Fennel Marmalada and Sautéed Mild Chili; and Sesame Crusted Filet of Pacific Sea Bass.The sides are as subtle as nominee Michelle Williams' performance in Blue Valentine:Light Cream of Fine Herb Tumeric Lemongrass SauceBlack Risotto ParmeseanYoung Bok Choy, Haricot Vert and Baby Carrot.And the sweets, by Exec Pastry Chef Thomas Henzi, are a trio as seductive as Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo in The Kids Are All Right: California Almond Cake; Chocolate Royaltine Crunch Triangle; and a Fresh Berry Tart withRaspberry Coulis, Orange & Vanilla Chantilly Crème with Chocolate Butterfly Silhouette.The party continues, with almost 4,000 guests filling the Beverly Hilton following the awards ceremony. More than 40 chefs, 110 culinary staff, 50 bartenders, 250 servers and 300 security personnel will be on hand to make sure everyone's treated like a Hollywood star.Read more: www.slashfood.com/2011/01/06/golden-globes-watch-and-the-winning-dish-is/#ixzz1AuT9UEkn
