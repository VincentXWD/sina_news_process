Fashion risk-takers helped the red carpet at Sunday's Golden Globes live up to its reputation as the liveliest of the awards season, with Helena Bonham Carter leading the way in mismatched — one red, one green — shoes.She topped her multicolored, printed cocktail frock with a wacky hairdo woven with black netting.It can't be described as a do or a don't: It's just pure Bonham Carter.Olivia Wilde cleared her own path in an oversized chocolate-brown ballgown by Marchesa with beading that mimicked a starry night. "I'm a wide load — give me 20 feet," Wilde joked."I like wearing big dresses, it's fun. We go to so many parties in this town, the Globes are something to play with in terms of fashion," she added.Still, there was room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., for waves of gowns in green, red, black and blush tones.Angelina Jolie, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Elisabeth Moss in Donna Karan and Mila Kunis all did green justice, and the red looks on Sofia Vergara and January Jones were impossible to ignore. Jones actually requested this dress — originally on the Versace runway in blue — to be made in the bright lipstick hue.Black wasn't boring on a super-sexy Halle Berry, a voluptuous Eva Longoria and a sleek Piper Perabo.Sandra Bullock wore a powder shade and so did Scarlett Johansson, while Claire Danes, Lea Michele and Julianna Margulies picked pink.Natalie Portman covered her growing baby bump with a delicate, lengthwise flounce on her pink Viktor & Rolf that was adorned with a bright red flower at the bustline. "It was very suited for my body at the moment," Portman said. "I'm feeling good. It's kind of a disguise."(Agencies)
