The kids of "Glee" and "The Social Network" weren't just all right after the Golden Globe Awards, they were downright giddy at several post parties, making a scene singing, dancing and celebrating their wins during one of Hollywood's most booze-and-boogie-filled nights.Stars spilled into multiple soirees spread around the Beverly Hilton Hotel after Sunday's awards ceremony, indulging in champagne, upscale comfort food and mutual back-patting into the wee hours.Just before midnight, half of the young cast of "Glee" huddled together, strutted their moves and belted along to Journey's "Don't Stop Believin,'" blasted by a DJ at the Warner Bros. bash with In Style magazine at the hotel's Oasis courtyard. The hit musical Fox show won the trophy for television's best comedy or musical for its second year in a row.Twenty-year-old Chris Colfer, who snagged a supporting actor award for his role as a gay teen on the show, clutched his trophy in one hand and swayed to the tune, which "Glee" made more famous covering."Chris winning this year was like us winning last year. It was a shock. We all cried," gushed castmate Kevin McHale, 22. "We all really are best friends in real life."Towering over other revelers, 24-year-old actor Armie Hammer of "The Social Network" also shimmied to the music, and toasted the film about Facebook's founding, the night's big winner with trophies for best drama, best direction, best script and best score.Standing in a smoking area outside the party's large black tent — shimmery metal orbs were suspended from the ceiling as chandeliers — Hammer mused about his being a first-timer to the Globes, where guests schmooze both during and after the ceremony."It levels the playing field. It's like, there's Darren Aronofsky, and I say, 'I love your work!' And he's like, 'I love the Social Network!'" said Hammer, laughing, about meeting "The Black Swan" director. As for when he would end his long night, Hammer joked, "I'm a nonstop party."Other guests included Heidi Klum, Seal, Ryan Phillippe and Hayden Panettiere.At the annual roof party hosted by NBC, Universal Pictures and Focus Features, a mostly industry crowd packed the dance floor while a DJ spun funk and hip-hop, as a live MC rapped. The spread included mini grilled cheese sandwiches, mashed potatoes and mac 'n' cheese.Earlier in the evening, A-listers flocked to The Weinstein Company's party with Relativity Media, presented by Marie Claire magazine, at the lot adjacent to Bar 210, formerly Trader Vic's. Modest decorations included vases of roses and flickering candles.As studio head Harvey Weinstein milled around shaking hands with guests, "The King's Speech" best actor winner Colin Firth settled into an outdoor booth in the back with his wife and his co-star Guy Pearce. Co-star Helena Bonham Carter, surrounded by a thick throng of fans, joined later.Firth, calm and self-deprecatory, with his trophy on the table and a tumbler in hand, accepted compliments, but joked "I don't have many accomplishments" when asked how his win ranked against other pinnacles in his life. Firth said he had to catch a flight home to London on Monday, and didn't know how late his revelry would go.Looking fairly worn from the night's festivities, Steve Buscemi plopped into a booth across from Firth with his own best actor trophy for HBO's "Boardwalk Empire."Co-star Kelly Macdonald flitted from Buscemi to Bonham Carter, smiling about the show's win for best television drama, surrounded by the likes of celebs such as Kyra Sedgwick, Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood."I've been to these parties before, but I feel like I'm one of the cool kids now," said Macdonald.Case in point, new "American Idol" judge Jennifer Lopez made a splashy exit from the party with her husband Marc Anthony. A pack of bodyguards flanked them as they wound their way up and down hallways and out the door.Unlike last year, when rain soaked the red carpet, balmy weather made for a lovely, packed HBO bash at the hotel's Circa 55 restaurant, where many stars headed right after the awards ceremony. The party's green, brown and yellow Mod geometric theme extended to the carpet, pillows, table cloths and chairs. Sculptural golden pillars and burning candles on floating round islands decorated the patio's outdoor pool.Sean "Diddy" Combs sat and chatted with "The Fighter" nominee Mark Wahlberg, feasting on steaming risotto, kale, grilled veggies, sea bass and beef with tomatoes. Ricky Gervais rested and laughed after his Globe hosting duties at a nearby table, sans jacket. Halle Berry's boyfriend Olivier Martinez rubbed the best actress nominee's shoulders as she finished eating. "Twilight" hunk Rob Pattinson navigated the crowd."I'm already tired. I'm going to be exhausted tomorrow," said Claire Danes, who snagged a best actress trophy for the HBO miniseries "Temple Grandin." Wahlberg left the bash early at 9 p.m. to catch a plane to shoot the film "Contraband" in New Orleans."I have an 8 a.m. call time," he told The Associated Press, while high-fiving friends.At the Fox party on other side of the hotel, best actress winner Natalie Portman smiled and greeted young members of the ABC show "Modern Family," showing off her trophy for "The Black Swan" as well as her baby bump in a high necked, pleated A-line dress by Azzaro, which was looser than her earlier pink gown.Guests congregated underneath an enormous white tent with sheer ceiling drapings as a DJ spun Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson tunes. A photo booth sponsored by Ultimat Vodka attracted partiers on a patio outside.Colfer, making an appearance at Fox before heading to the other parties, grinned about where the night would take him."When is sunrise? I'm going to party an hour after that," he said.(Agencies)
