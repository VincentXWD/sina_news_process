Venice is preparing to roll out the red carpet for one of its most star-studded editions in recent years.Film makers from around the world will descend on the canal city from August 31 to September 10 to showcase their movies, and attend a whirlwind of photocalls, press conferences, interviews and parties.Ahead of the opening night, artistic director Marco Mueller is oozing confidence over his selection of films.SOUNDBITE Artistic director Marco Mueller saying (English):"It does really resemble the program we have wanted to put together from my first year eight years ago in the sense that it is a program that tells you how much support we get from the artists, the film-makers but also the producers and world sales, the international distributors and it proves that Venice really stands as a major platform to create a special kind of visibility."The 68th Venice film festival has put high costs and growing competition from Toronto aside and provided a line-up of hotly anticipated titles and Hollywood stars including Madonna and Roman Polanski.Blockbusters rarely feature, but a slot in Venice is coveted by lower-budget U.S. productions for the exposure it brings and because it acts as the unofficial launch of the annual awards season ending with the Oscars.George Clooney, a regular favorite at the world's oldest film festival is held, kicks off the glamorous 11-day event on Wednesday (August 31) with "The Ides of March", a political drama which he also directed.His cast includes Ryan Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman.(Agencies)
