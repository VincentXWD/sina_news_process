Madonna hits Venice festival

Madonna's directorial debut three years ago led one critic to suggest she stick to the day job.Undeterred, the Material Girl is at the Venice film festival with her second stab behind the camera, 'W.E.'The film re-tells the story of American divorcee Wallis Simpson, whose affair with Britain's King Edward VIII led him to abdicate the throne.While Madonna remains one of the music world's biggest stars, she said it was her ex-husbands who urged her to take her place in the director's chair.SOUNDBITE, Madonna, singer and film director, saying (English):"Needless to say I see myself as a story teller, so I don't think it's such a big jump to go from song writing to making films, because in the end we are all telling stories. And I was attracted to very creative people which is why I married Sean Penn and Guy Ritchie, two very talented directors. And they both encouraged me as a director and as a creative person to do what I did, they were both very supportive."Madonna says she sees parallels between herself and Simpson, a woman who was vilified by many for her role in a constitutional crisis.She added that she hopes the success of "The King's Speech", set at the same time and in a similar world to W.E., would help, not harm her project.SOUNDBITE, Madonna, singer and film director, saying (English):"Well, before, I was a little bit nervous, because I thought, oh dear, if someone else is making a movie about the same time frame, then who would be interested in my movie? But then I saw the film and I saw that it was from a completely different point of view and I view the success of that film as sort of laying the ground work for my movie."Madonna had a famously rocky ride when she tried to become a movie star, and W.E. is playing outside the main competition in Venice.But if the queen of pop is judged to have succeeded behind the camera, it will be one in the eye for her critics.
