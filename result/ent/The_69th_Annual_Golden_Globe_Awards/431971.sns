Kelsey Grammer, Showtime's "Homeland" and movie actresses who turned to TV work were big winners Sunday night at the Golden Globes.Grammer was named best actor in a television drama for his performance as a powerful Chicago mayor in Starz's "Boss." The award was another indication of how the balance of power has shifted in television, with the commercial broadcast networks now struggling for recognition compared to cable."This is very nice," Grammer said, looking at his trophy.Three actresses — Jessica Lange, Laura Dern and Kate Winslet — who had won previous Golden Globes for movie roles won Sunday for their TV work.Lange, after receiving four Golden Globes for movies that included "A Streetcar Named Desire," won best supporting actress in a TV series for her role in FX's new "American Horror Story.""I find it ... rarer ever year to find a piece of work that is beautifully written and gives you something to do," Lange said. "It certainly was this."Dern and Winslet had won Globes for movie work before their wins Sunday. Dern was named best actress in a TV comedy for her role in HBO's "Enlightened," while Winslet won best actress in a TV miniseries or movie for her portrayal of the title character in HBO's "Mildred Pierce."Dern's mother, actress Diane Ladd, looked on proudly. Ladd also played Dern's mother in the series in which Dern plays environmental activist Amy Jellicoe. Dern thanked "all the whistleblowers out there. Amy couldn't exist without you."Showtime's new "Homeland," in which Claire Danes plays a CIA agent investigating terrorist threats, won the Globe for best TV drama. The Showtime series won in a category dominated by cable networks, including last year's winner, HBO's "Boardwalk Empire."Danes won the award for best actress in a TV drama. She remembered how she forgot to thank her parents when she won a Globe for "My So-Called Life" at age 15."I am so lucky to have another opportunity to let them know how lucky I am to have their love and encouragement," Danes said, accepting her third Globe."Mildred Pierce" didn't win best TV miniseries or movie, but Winslet won for her acting. She played a strong-willed divorcee in Depression-era California in this remake of the Joan Crawford classic."I want to thank HBO for being absent when we needed it to be absent, and being present when we needed a little more shooting time," Winslet said.PBS' "Downton Abbey" won for best TV miniseries or movie, beating out three nominees from HBO."How fabulous this is," said producer Julian Fellowes. "The whole 'Downton Abbey' adventure has been an extraordinary one, like spotting a promising child and waking up to find they won the Olympics."Idris Elba, who plays the detective John Luther in BBC America's "Luther," won the Globe for best actor in a TV movie or miniseries. He looked at the camera and saluted his daughter, who he said was hosting a Golden Globe party.Peter Dinklage, one of the few American actors in the mostly British "Game of Thrones" on HBO, won the award for best supporting actor. In his speech, he admitted to being "a little nervous" because he and his wife hired a baby sitter for the first time for their daughter.
