The 69th annual Golden Globe awards show is kind of like the little sister of the award shows. It gets away with a bit more mischief and a lot more fun than its responsible, older sibling, the Academy Awards does later in the year. The Foreign Press Association seems to court controversy, asking back Ricky Gervais to host again this year even after his controversial comments last time around. Here, some of the show's top moments.Madonna's Racy CommentMadonna, who got a statue her tune "Masterpiece" from the movie "W.E.," which she also directed, stepped forward to present the award for best foreign film. And that's when things got naughty. Ricky Gervais started it with this introduction: "She's always vogue. She's a material girl. And she's just like a virgin," he said sarcastically.Without missing a beat, Madonna stepped up to the mic and delivered this zinger: "If I'm still just like a virgin, Ricky, then why don't you come over here and do something about it? I haven't kissed a girl in a few years … on TV."Though she was looking back at her onstage kiss with Britney Spears, Madonna's (most likely unintentional) reference to another princess of pop didn't go unnoticed. Moments after Madonna joked about how long it's been since she "kissed a girl," the "I Kissed a Girl" singer herself, Katy Perry, tweeted, "Madge looks goooooood. I'd tap that. #goldenglobes." Oh, it's on!Michelle Williams' Marilyn MomentLooking glowing and modern with her pixie cut and vintage Jason Wu gown, Michelle Williams picked up a best actress award for "My Week with Marilyn"… and thanked her daughter for helping her prepare for the role of the screen siren."I consider myself a mother first and an actress second," the actress said in her acceptance speech. The star spoke of her 6-year-old daughter Matilda's "bravery and exuberance" as " the example I take with me in my life and work."Williams thanked her daughter for "suffering through six months of bedtime stories where all the princesses were read aloud in a Marilyn Monroe-sounding voice." We're sure many fans would hardly consider that suffering.Clooney Clowns AroundWhen it was his turn to introduce best drama nominee "Moneyball," which stars his pal Brad Pitt, George Clooney walked out on stage sporting Mr. Pitt's cane. The "Moneyball" actor had appeared on the red carpet earlier that night walking with the cane after injuring his knee while carrying his daughter Vivienne down a hill recently.  Clooney, who managed to make walking with a stick look dashing, joked, "I have to give it back to him or he can't get to the bar."The Descendents" star — who took home a best actor award -- gave another shout-out to his friend and fellow nominee Pitt when accepting his award. The gracious Clooney noted, "It's nice to see Brad and it's nice to be able to tell him not just what wonderful work he's doing in two films this year but what wonderful work he does in the rest of the world. I'm a fan." Right back atcha, George.
