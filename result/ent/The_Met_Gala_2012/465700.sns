The carpet may have been red, but at the 2012 Met Gala, the color of the night was pink. SHOCKING pink, in homage to Elsa Schiaparelli. And it was Coco Rocha who outdid everyone's pink dresses, jackets and shoes with bright pink hair.The brunette model's ends were totally dip-dyed, popping against her yellow jumpsuit. And that jumpsuit! Canary yellow by Givenchy, worn by Elizabeth Taylor (and with a wine stain to show for it). She finished the look with a pink top and pretty pink shoes, natch.Chris Benz and Julie Macklowe both had pink hair, Hamish Bowles wore a pink tuxedo jacket and Paul Patton was swathed in a pale pink shade. But we'd venture to say Coco had the best hue of the night. What do you think of her ombre strands?Â
