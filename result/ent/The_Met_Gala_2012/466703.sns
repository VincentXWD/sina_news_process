Met Gala had some fashion head-scratchers

 The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala on Monday had more than its share of gorgeous gowns on the red carpet, as we showed in our photo gallery. But there were some other fashion moments that were drawing stares for other reasons. Christina Ricci's Thakoon dress with the ginourmous bow, for instance. Did she plan to stand up all night? Florence Welch's Alexander McQueen made her look like a wedding cake or a polar bear. Marc Jacobs was the night's most outre, in a transparent lace dress, white boxers and pilgrim-buckle shoes. "I didn't want to be boring," he reportedly said. Also eye-catching, but more in a good way, was model Coco Rocha who bypassed gowns for a stunning vintage Givenchy pants outfit, pink bustier, shoes by Sergio Rossi and pink dip-dyed hair. It didn't quite match the occasion, but it sure was a fun look.
