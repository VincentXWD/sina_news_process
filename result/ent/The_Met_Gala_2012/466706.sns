The Metropolitan Costume Institute Gala, best known as the Met Gala and renowned for its impressive celebrity guest list, took place in New York on Monday evening (May 7, 2012). This year's show - which celebrated Miuccia Prada and Elsa Schiaparelli - was described as "the most star-studded one yet", by US Weekly magazine.Though the event was awash with stunning designer gowns, it was the same handful of celebrities that were being tipped as the best dressed by the end of the evening. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' actress Emma Stone - who wowed at the Oscars earlier this year - donned a red Lanvin above-the-knee dress hand embroidered with crystal flowers. Elsewhere, Jessica Alba turned heads in a gold Michael Kors gown, with Scarlett Johansson opting for a strapless Dolce & Gabbana gown with mermaid skirt and embroidered bodice. Newlywed Carey Mulligan emerged as Emma Stone's nearest rival, with a dazzling sequined silver-and-gold Prada halter design. Beyonce was flaunting her post-baby figure in a sheer, figure- hugging gown by Givenchy Haute Couture, while Sarah Jessica Parker looked predictably elegant in a white Valentino dress.Elsewhere at the star-studded event, Justin Timberlake made a rare public appearance with his fiance JESSICA BIEL.Â
