BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhuanet) -- Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton will take place at Westminster Abbey, the church where Princess Diana's funeral was held, according to UK media reports.Royal officials said Tuesday that the couple chose the venue for its beauty, intimacy and historic royal connections.This will be the 15th royal wedding conducted during the 1,000-year history of the Collegiate Church of St Peter, Westminster.It has also been confirmed by David Carmeron that the nation would be given an extra bank holiday to celebrate the marriage, which will be held on Friday, April 29."The wedding of Kate and William will be a happy and momentous occasion. We want to mark the day as one of national celebration, a public holiday will ensure the most people possible will have a chance to celebrate on the day," Cameron said in a statement.It means Britain will be open for business on only three days between April 22 and May 2, because Easter is the weekend before the wedding, and the May Day bank holiday is the following Monday.According to The Telegraph reports, the wedding will cost the economy about 7.9 billion US dollars (about 5 billion pounds) by creating consecutive four-day weekends in April.(Agencies)
