Prince William exhibits his beloved mother, Diana's qualities as he confidently makes decisions concerning his upcoming wedding plans with Kate Middleton. He is doing things his way and not someone else's.William has given an open invitation to ordinary folks, children, volunteers and the homeless to fill the pews of Westminster Abbey on his wedding day. He wants to look on familiar faces when he stands with his bride, Kate, by his side.The April 29 wedding date has been declared a holiday for the entire United Kingdom, as it will be considered an occasion for national celebration. William wants the wedding to be done on a grand scale with street parties around London on the big day. There will also be a concert by Britain's top pop stars, and a bank holiday the weekend after Easter. For many this could mean a break stretching to 11 days if they take time off between the successive four-day holiday weekends of Easter and May Day.Pubs in both England and Wales plan to stay open longer for the royal wedding weekend. They will be at the heart of the celebrations with nonstop TV broadcasting as well as providing excellent food and entertainment.William continues to take control in making wedding plans that celebrate their love, not an occasion for pomp and circumstance. Yes, there may be soaring anthems heard by heads of state in the Westminster Abbey, and a gilded carriage ride before joyously exuberant crowds. But his concerns are for the Middletons; he does not want them to feel besieged by the occasion, but rather experience a sense of enjoyment in the couple's wedding day.As of today things continue to move along according to William's wishes. He refused a summer wedding, opting instead for April even if it meant possible rain. His argument is that he and Kate have been together long enough; a long engagement is unnecessary.William exemplifies the determined will of a future king. By making a point of doing things his way now, he sets precedence for his expectations as king. There may be clashing of 'Wills" now, but he is to be admired for taking charge in decisions.Initially, William chose to be married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, but after discussion with his grandparents, he changed his mind. When Kate saw Westminster Abbey, she fell in love with it, effectively clinching the decision. The Queen was delighted that her grandson chose the same church where she and Prince Philip tied the knot 63 years ago.It is clear from the events taking place that William delights in doing things his way. He may have a stubborn streak, but he also exhibits an enormous capacity for self-control and assertion. He conducts himself as his mother did.We are beginning to glimpse the kind of king he will one day become. His singe-minded purpose has kept him out of trouble and on course. It is said that his father is often seen wringing his hands in indecision. This is not the case with William. When he decides on a particular path, he does it.William has chosen to begin his marriage to Kate as he expects to go on. Time will tell as we anticipate great things from him.(Agencies)
