2011-02-14 08:28:37 GMT
It's just two months more until the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. When Kate marches down the aisle of Westminster Abbey, she will be accompanied by her little sister, Pippa Middleton. Thrust into the spotlight after Kate Middleton, 29, asked her sister to serve as maid of honor, Pippa, 27, has garnered almost as much attention as the bride herself. But she's more than the little sister. Here are five things any royal wedding follower needs to know about the maid of honor: Off the Market? While her sister is engaged to one of the world's most eligible bachelors, Pippa's love life has also found the spotlight. In 2008, Tatler magazine named her the No. 1 Society Singleton, beating out musician James Blunt and Princess Eugenie, daughter of Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew. But Pippa may be off the market now that Alex Loudon, an old friend of Prince William's, is in the picture. The couple reportedly started dating before Christmas, and it's rumored we'll see Loudon on Pippa's arm as her date to the royal wedding. Pippa is Just a Nickname Although commonly referred to as Pippa, Kate's younger sister's full name is Philippa Charlotte Middleton. But family members, including her sister Kate, call her Pip. The origin of Philippa means "lover of horses" in Greek. Although she has never taken up horseback riding, Pippa can often be seen with her sister on the sidelines at Prince William's polo matches. She's Following in Her Family's Footsteps In the summer of 2010, Pippa put her English degree from Edinburgh University to use when she launched The Party Times, an online party magazine. The site is a must-see destination with everything one needs to know about planning parties, and includes theme ideas, tips and games. Pippa knows a lot about the party planning business, considering her parents founded Party Pieces, an online party supply company in 1987. It is even rumored that party-planner Pippa will be at the helm of the biggest event this year: her sister's wedding. (Agencies)
