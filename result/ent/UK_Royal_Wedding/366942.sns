Even a future King of England gets pre-wedding jitters.Prince William says his "knees started tapping quite nervously" recently in a rehearsal for his April 29 marriage to Kate Middleton, adding that "the whole thing" is giving him a few sleepless nights.William spoke Friday after a training exercise at RAF Valley ahead of a visit from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. William is a search and rescue helicopter pilot at the base.He says the wedding is a "daunting prospect but very exciting" and that "there's still a lot of planning to be done."One thing he's proud of so far: throwing the press off the tracks of his recent bachelor party. William says "it's quite good news" that he and his brother were able "to outfox the media."(Agencies)
