Kate Middleton will surprise us all

With two weeks to go until the royal wedding, rumors are starting to fly even more furiously about what Kate Middleton will be wearing on her wedding day. In absence of any hard facts, a few designers have been brought up as "insider information" -- Alexander McQueen protegee Sarah Burton not long ago and more recently Sophie Cranston have been declared to be the designer, as well as well-established designer Bruce Oldfield, just to name a few -- but nothing has been proven. The royal family is treating this with the same tight-lipped silence that they give to state secrets, refusing to even comment on the existence of the rumors.This may be a response to the media frenzy over Diana, Princess of Wales' wedding gown. In 1981, David and Elizabeth Emanuel were announced as the designers of Diana's dress, and the media went into overdrive trying to find out every last detail of their creation before the July wedding. This time around, Buckingham Palace has announced that a press release containing all the sartorial details of the gown will be released on the day of the wedding, as soon as the bride exits the car on her way into Westminster Abbey.Two things we do know are that Kate has chosen to wear her hair down for her wedding, and that she will be wearing flats. (Wouldn't do to trip in front of nearly a billion people, would it?)I remain convinced that while Kate Middleton has tended to stick with designers she likes -- we have seen pictures of her in many gowns by Daniella Helayel Issa, the maker of the now-famous blue engagement dress -- she may likely use the opportunity to kick-start the career of a designer who is a relative unknown.The Emanuels were only a year out of fashion school when Diana came calling, and thirty years later, both have become established couture designers. Kate has reportedly hired hat maker Philip Treacy, whose creations Kate has worn in the past, to be involved somehow, sparking speculations that instead of a veil or tiara, she may wear a hat or fascinator, or even flowers in her hair.If this is so, just the idea is proving that Kate is choosing to forge her own path as a princess. We won't know for sure until April 29, but I expect that this new path will be reflected in both her dress and her choice of designer.
