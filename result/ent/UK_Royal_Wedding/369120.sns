Kate Middleton's parents will pay nearly £100,000 ($163,000, 113,000 euros) for their daughter's wedding to Prince William later this month, a report said Sunday.Hotel suites, bridal gowns, bridesmaids' dresses, the maid of honour's outfit and the honeymoon will all be paid for by Carole and Michael Middleton, The Sunday Times newspaper said, without citing its sources.They will pay for several suites at the Goring hotel in the upmarket London district of Belgravia, including a two-bedroom, five-room suite for Kate and her sister Pippa, her maid of honour, said the paper.Carole and Michael and their son James, Kate's brother, will also reportedly take rooms in the hotel, not far from Buckingham Palace, for the April 29 wedding at London's Westminster Abbey.The hotel bill alone is expected to exceed Â£20,000, the paper said.The Middletons, who have earned millions from their party goods business "Party Pieces", are thought to have paid £30,000 for Kate's bridal gowns and £20,000 for Pippa's dress, it added.The royal family is sharing the cost of the wedding with the Middletons, while the government is picking up the bill for security.
