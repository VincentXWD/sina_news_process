LONDON - She may be pretty, wealthy and about to marry a prince, but an overwhelming majority of British women do not envy Kate Middleton, a survey showed on Wednesday.Asked how much they envied Prince William's fiancee, 86 percent of women polled by YouGov said they did not feel jealous at all.The main reason why most women did not want to swap fortunes with Middleton was her perceived inability to lead a normal life after she and the second in line to the British throne tie the knot on April 29th, said MyDaily.co.uk, a women's website which commissioned the poll."Most women realise Catherine has an unenviable task ahead of her, having her every move, not to mention every outfit, picked apart by the press," said Carla Bevan, editor-in-chief of MyDaily.co.uk."The public clearly feel it's going to be no fairytale for Kate."But there were some who envied the future Princess Catherine. A 10th of respondents said they wished to be in her shoes, and for almost a third of these women the main attraction of being Kate Middleton was her wealth.YouGov surveyed just over 1,000 women aged 18 and older between March 30 and April 1.
