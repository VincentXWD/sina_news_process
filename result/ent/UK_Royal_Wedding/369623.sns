Kate Middleton's coat of arms blends symbolism and history

Kate Middleton's family might have chosen something festive for their coat of arms. Bearing in mind that the family fortune is based on supplying mail-order party accessories, crossed balloons on a field of serviettes with blowers rampant, perhaps?Nothing so irreverent: the crest that the family has chosen in consultation with the College of Arms consists of three acorns separated with gold and white chevrons.There are two in-jokes, but you probably have to be a medieval French herald to appreciate them fully: the gold chevron refers to Carole Middleton's maiden name, Goldsmith, and the division down the centre of the crest between blue and red is a little pun on the Middle-ton name.The rest of the design is also laden with symbolism: the three acorns represent Michael and Carole Middleton's three children, Kate, Pippa and James, as well as strength and Englishness. Oak trees are common around the family's Berkshire home village of Bucklebury, reputedly since Nelson's colleague Admiral Collingwood passed that way after Trafalgar, scattering acorns so that the Royal Navy should never be short of ships' timber.The narrow, white chevrons represent hills and mountains, a reference to the family's enjoyment of outdoor pursuits, and the blue and red background refers to the colours of the union flag.While a family crest might not have been strictly necessary for the family's oldest daughter to marry the second in line to the throne, now that royal brides do not necessarily come equipped with their own escutcheons, it certainly helps her to fit in.At the moment Kate Middleton's armature is lozenge-shaped and hangs from blue ribbons – signs that she is an unmarried daughter – but it will be transformed by her marriage into a shield. And, in due course, once a royal warrant is issued by William's grandmother, her coat of arms will be impaled in the centre of her husband's crest. The rest of the Middleton family and their descendants will be able to carry the original crest for the rest of their days.Thomas Woodcock, Garter King of Arms, who devised the coat of arms over the past few months, mainly in consultation with Michael Middleton, said: "The purpose is to provide a traditional heraldic identity for Catherine as she marries into the royal family. The intent was to represent the whole Middleton family together, their home and aspects of what they enjoy."Heraldry is Europe's oldest, most visual and strictly regulated form of identity and it surrounds us in Britain, giving clues to our history and surroundings. After her marriage, Catherine Middleton will place her father's arms beside those of her husband in what is known as an impaled coat of arms."The quaint medievalism sits strangely alongside the palace's arrangements for hi-tech wedding coverage. There will be live streaming on YouTube's royal channel, Flickr and Twitter and even an official video wedding book for the public to send the couple their best wishes – though for that "there will be some pre-moderation, as you would expect", an official said.A palace spokesman said: "Both William and Catherine are very familiar with YouTube and Facebook and they have taken a keen interest in this. They are the same as any other people of their age in terms of social media. Catherine designed the Party Pieces website and helped devise the royal wedding website."(Agencies)
