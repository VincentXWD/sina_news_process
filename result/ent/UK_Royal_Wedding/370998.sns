A book entitled "Knit Your Own Royal Wedding", by Fiona Goble, gives instructions on how to knit figures that look like Britain's Prince William, Kate Middleton and other members of the royal family, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury. The book contains a fold-out balcony on which to display the figures. (Agencies)
