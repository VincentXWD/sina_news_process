Yang Lifei, a Chinese fashion designer, originally made a copy of the gown for a British TV channel. After the dress was completed, her small wedding dress business received more than half a dozen orders in her hometown and other parts of China, as well as Paris, with prices ranging from 3,500 RMB ($540) in China to 8,000 RMB ($1230) in France. Britain's Prince William married his fiancee, Kate Middleton, last Friday. Her wedding dress was designed by Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton, ending months of fevered speculation in the fashion world over who would create one of the most talked-about outfits of the decade.(Agencies)
