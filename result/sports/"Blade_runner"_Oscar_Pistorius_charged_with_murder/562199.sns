A bloody cricket bat found at Oscar Pistorius' home is the latest piece of evidence prosecutors say proves that he murdered his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, according to reports.South Africa's City Press reported that officials are investigating different scenarios that could have unfolded with the bat, but reports state that 29-year-old Steenkamp's head was reportedly "crushed."Tests are being done to find out if the bat was the cause of her head injuries."There was lots of blood on the bat," a police source told Jagran Post. "The suspicion is that the first shot, in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and hid herself in the toilet... He fired three more shots."It is also possible that Steenkamp used the bat to defend herself.State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said last week that he planned to argue that the Olympian had committed a "premeditated murder," the New York Daily News reported.On Friday, the Pistorius family released a statement describing Steenkamp's “terrible, terrible tragedy” and disputing the murder charges "in the strongest terms."(Agencies)
