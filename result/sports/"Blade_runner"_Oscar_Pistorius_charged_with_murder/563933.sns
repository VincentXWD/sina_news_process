Nike Inc. suspended on Thursday its contract with double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius, as the Olympian faces murder charges in the Valentine's Day shooting of his girlfriend.Pistorius, 26, is accused of a premeditated killing of model Reeva Steenkamp, though he claims he mistakenly took her for an intruder."Nike has suspended its contract with Oscar Pistorius," the company said in a statement. "We believe Oscar Pistorius should be afforded due process and we will continue to monitor the situation closely."Eyewear maker Oakley Inc. suspended its contract with Pistorius on Monday.Earlier this week, Nike announced that it had no plans to use him in future ad campaigns. An ad featuring Pistorius that said, "I am the bullet in the chamber," was pulled from his personal web site on Feb. 14.Called the "Blade Runner" for his carbon-fiber running blades, Pistorius is known for his track success against able-bodied athletes. He won gold and bronze medals at the first Paralympic Games in Athens in 2004, and set a world record in the 200 meters. He qualified for the London Olympics in the 400 meters and 4x400 relay last summer.(Agencies)
