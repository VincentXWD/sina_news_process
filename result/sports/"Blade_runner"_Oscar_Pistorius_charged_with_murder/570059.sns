The South African Paralympian stands accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day, in a case which has left him bailed but broken, according to his friend.The 26-year-old, who claims he shot Steenkamp through a bathroom door thinking she was an intruder, is said to be resembling a man who “doesn’t know where he is going”.Close friend Mike Azzie said the athlete has been left "a broken man" since the incident, speaking in the upcoming BBC3 documentary 'Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened?'.Azzie said Pistorius, who is out on bail, regularly talks about Steenkamp as he awaits his next court appearance on June 4 and that his state of mind has worsened since he was tasked with selling his racehorses to raise money to pay for his spiralling legal fees."He just always seems to mention Reeva and to ask us to pray for her and her family," Azzie said. "But most of all, you've got to understand that we are there for him and we will always be his friend."He has no confidence in his tone of voice and he is just a man that is almost like someone that is walking around in circles and doesn't know where he is going."I would say that, just speaking to him, that he is a broken man and that I would go as far to say that he would be on the verge of suicide. It really worries me."The documentary also shows Steenkamp's close friend Gina Myers taking the cameras into her bedroom as she recalls the last time that they were together."I was doing my hair and she was getting ready for a meeting and I was getting ready to go to work," Myers said."And when she left she told me I was going to be awesome and that she loved me and then I ran out and then I gave her a hug and she left."Police in Johannesburg said they have requested all records of phone calls and messages exchanged between Pistorius and Steenkamp on the day she was killed, according to the documentary makers.Officers added they were also sifting through a "massive" number of texts on Steenkamp's phone, producers said.There are no plans for police to enter into a plea bargain with Pistorius's legal team for a lesser charge, the show's makers claimed.(Agencies)
