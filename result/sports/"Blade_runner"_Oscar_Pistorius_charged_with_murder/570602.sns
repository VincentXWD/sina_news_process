Slain South African model Reeva Steenkamp shared a low-key coffee date with her ex-boyfriend of five years just two days before she was gunned down by Oscar Pistorius, investigators have learned.The 29-year-old stunner's meet-up with ex-flame Warren Lahoud was nothing more than two old pals catching up, Lahoud said, according to Britain's London Evening Standard.But Pistorius may have thought differently, Lahoud said.The South African businessmen said he was struck that the track star called Steenkamp twice in 20 minutes during their brief cafe chat."I said, 'Is everything okay. I mean he's phoned twice already.' I asked her that question," Lahoud said in an upcoming BBC documentary, according to the newspaper."She said, 'There's nothing wrong.'"Steenkamp seemed to mean it."She seemed fine. We didn't really discuss personal relationships; it was more a friendly thing," Lahoud said."She didn't seem unhappy. She told me that she wouldn't be with anybody that she felt unhappy with, or she wouldn't allow herself to be with somebody like that."Pistorius is accused of shooting Steenkamp to death on Valentine's Day.He claimed he mistook her for an intruder who had broken into his bathroom.Prosecutors said it was a premeditated murder stemming from an argument.Investigators were looking to review the bikini model's text messages in the days before her death, the newspaper said.Lahoud said they'd find messages from him, but none likely to shed any light on the case."She contacted me and we met up for a quick coffee, and that was it," Lahoud said in the BBC Three program, set to air Monday. "We did (text), to meet up the previous week."Elsewhere in the documentary, a close friend of Pistorius says the Blade Runner is possibly on the verge of suicide.Pal Mike Azzi says the Olympian, who has been holed up at his uncle home in a Pretoria suburb since he was granted bail on Feb. 22, is "a broken man" who can't take his mind off Steenkamp."He just always seems to mention Reeva and to ask us to pray for her and her family," Azzi said in doc, titled "Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened?"On Friday, Pistorius' lawyers filed an appeal to his bail conditions, saying he is not a flight risk and shouldn't be barred from travelling outside of South Africa as long as he receives permission.(Agencies)
