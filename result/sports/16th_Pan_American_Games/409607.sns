It wasn't that hard," said Robles with confidence.The king of the 110m hurdles in Guadalajara was presented as one of the leaders of the Cuban athletics, two months after he was disqualified in the his mark and the title in the IAAF World Championships in Daegu for obstructing China's Liu Xiang.Robles had clinched golds in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the World 2010 Indoor Championships in Doha.
