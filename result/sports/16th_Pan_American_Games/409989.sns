GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- The 16th Pan-American Games closed here on Sunday.After a spectacular 'waterfall' of fireworks, the athletes from the 42 delegations entered the stadium with joy and excitement.Under the Olympic spirit of brotherhood, the athletes entered together without much distinction except for the sports uniforms they wore that stamped the flags of Colombia, Argentina, Cuba, El Salvador and Mexico alike.Emilio Gonzalez Marquez, governor of Jalisco, said in an emotional speech that "the Mexico that visitors have seen is a Mexico in which Mexicans believe.""Failed to deliver a medal to Jalisco ... Thanks for making these the great party games of America! This is a gold medal! It is for you, for Jalisco and for Mexico!" said Gonzalez.The Pan American flag was handed over to the mayor of the Canadian city of Toronto, Rob Ford. The Ontario capital will host the Games in July 2015 and the weeklong Para Pan-American Games will be held the following month.It will be the third time for Canada to host the Pan Ams, which Winnipeg also hosted in 1967 and 1999.
