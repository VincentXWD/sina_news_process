Everything's happy except the ending

Beijing - She didn't actually win, but she left feeling like a winner again. Despite pulling out of her quarterfinal match against Agnieszka Radwanska, Serbia's Ana Ivanovic - the 2008 French Open winner - said she will be aiming at another Grand Slam title thanks to the confidence she gained during the amazing week she had in Beijing. The former world No 1 defeated Japanese veteran Kimiko Date Krumm in the opening round, then breezed through two-time Grand Slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova and third seed Vera Zvonareva, both in straight sets. The match against Zvonareva marked her first victory over a top-five player this season. "Actually I have already surprised myself by going to this stage," Ivanovic said. "I've been playing really good tennis here, and it is really very disappointing to end in this way." Ivanovic retired from her match due to a back problem after losing the first set and falling behind, 3-2, in the second. "This week is probably the best I've played in years," she said. "The things I've been working on came together in the match. It's very inspiring. I will try to focus on the next couple of tournaments and have a good ending this year." The 24-year-old has already received a wild card entry at the year-end Bali Championships. After winning at Roland Garros in 2008, she's failed to make it back to a Grand Slam final. She finished with a 24-14 match record in 2009 - her worst since turning pro in 2003 - and did not win any titles. She ended the year ranked 21st, the first time she had been ranked outside the top 20 since July 2005. After getting eliminated in the first round at Wimbledon last year, her ranking fell all the way to No 64. She's bounced back since, and came to Beijing ranked No 18. Now, she's looking forward to getting back to her peak form and challenging for another major title. "I'm very excited," Ivanovic said of her play at China Open. "I'm striking the ball really well. It's really a good incentive. I will try to have a really nice season next year. I hope next year will be a big year for me. I really feel I have an opportunity to return to top form again and maybe, you know, win a Grand Slam." Eleventh seed Radwanska, who won her first Premier 5 title at the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo last week, will play Flavia Pennetta of Italy in the semifinals. Pennetta downed top seed and world No 1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 3-6, 6-0, 7-6 on Thursday.
