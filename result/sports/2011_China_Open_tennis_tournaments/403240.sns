BEIJING, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Croatian big server Marin Cilic outscored compatriot Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-3 to march into the final at China Open here on Saturday.The 23-year-old world No. 25 powered 13 aces through the match, four more than his opponent, and converted three of his break points to win the match.Sunday's final would be Cilic's third final show in the 2011 season. The top ranking Croat, who pocketed at least one title in past three years, was still in want of a ATP champion in 2011.Both players held their serve in the first eight games. Cilic met huge pressure at the sixth game in which Ljubicic got two break points in hand, but Cilic managed to survive both of them to level the score to 3-3.Cilic found a chance in the ninth game, completing the first break in the match to take a 5-4 lead. The former world No. 9 held his serve to take the first set 6-4.The second set went on more or less the same as the first one. Cilic strengthened his serves, while 32-year-old Ljubicic struggled with his returns. Cilic made another two breaks in the second set to end the match 6-3.Two years ago, Cilic advanced into final at the same tournament, only to swallow a defeat from current world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.Cilic would next face either top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or the third seed Tomas Berdych at the final on Sunday.
