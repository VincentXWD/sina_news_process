BEIJING, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Czech third seed Tomas Berdych muscled out top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France here on Saturday to reach the final of the 2.1-million-U.S.-dollar China Open ATP tournament, while Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska saw off Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-2, 6-4 to enter the women's singles final.It was the first meet between the two top ten ranked athletes and both sides served strongly through out the match, with the tenth ranked Berdych served in eight aces while world No. 7 Tsonga gave ten.Both sides seemed nail-biting in front of the opponent's powerfully serves and the match remained close as each side claimed a set 6-4 to come to the decider.The 26-year-old Berdych fought more bravely and maintain the rhythm of the deciding set. The Czech gained an early break in the fourth game to lead 3-1 and then continued to extend the margin to 5-1 by making the sixth game a love one. In the seventh game, the in-form Czech sent in his eights ace ball to claim the two-hour-and-six-minute victory.Berdych will face Marin Cilic of Croatia in Sunday's final. The 1.98-meter Crot, who was also known as a big server, beat his countryman Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-3 in the other semifinal.It is the first time for the 26-year-old Berdych to reach a final clash in this season and the Czech was expecting a tough match."So tomorrow, playing against Marin Cilic, it's another tough opponent. We played couple matches against each other. I remember few years ago in Shanghai very close one. And then from semifinal of Davis Cup, again five sets both for my side. So I'm expecting really tough one tomorrow," Berdych said.Compared with Berdych, the world 12th ranked was more productive this season as she has already claimed two single titles this season including the title of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo earlier this month.In front of a gritty Pennetta on Saturday, Radwanska continued her solid form. Although she lost her serve in the first game of the first set, the Polish girl quickly showed her strength in the second and forth to break, with the score up to 3-1. Then the world No.12 was in full possession of the following games to win the first set 6-2.Radwanska gained a total of five breaks in the whole match, which guaranteed she can still take an advantage of Pennetta in the second set. With the Italian's return ball flying out-of-bounds, Radwanska claimed the second set 6-4 and thus to seal the victory in 1 hour 23 minutes.The victory over Pennetta is the 10th win in a row for Radwanska, which keeps the 12th-ranked alive in the race to earn a place in the season-ending WTA Championships in Istanbul late this month.The 22-year-old will encounter German ninth seed Andrea Petkovic in the final. The German overwhelmed Romanian qualifier Monica Niculescu 6-2, 6-0 on Saturday."Well, we played actually in U.S. two times against each other," said Radwanska. "I won those both matches. But I think doesn't mean anything. It's always very tough and very tight against Andrea. She's playing well, a very consistent player. So I think I have to play even better than today to beat her tomorrow."
