BEIJING, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) -- Tomas Berdych ended a 29-month title drought to win the men's singles trophy while Agieszka Radwanska of Poland claimed her back-to-back title for the month on Sunday at the China Open tennis tournaments which was plagued by a series of withdrawals and early exits from big names.Czech third seed Berdych rallied to beat Croatian big server Marin Cilic 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 to harvest his first title since May, 2009. It was the 26-year-old Czech's first China Open title, and also the sixth ATP title in his career."To bring this title, that means really a lot to me," said Berdych after the match. "29 months was quite a long time, so I'm happy that I could break this up."The current world No. 10 eliminated Jurgen Melzer, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Fernando Verdasco and No. 1 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route to his first ATP showing in 15 months.Berdych started the final match in a passive way, broken once to allow Cilic a 3-0 lead. Although Berdych kept his serve in the fourth game, he missed his only chance to break in the seventh game. Cilic powered an ace to finish the first set 6-3."I was playing really good tennis in the first set," said Cilic. "That first set went really well on my side, and Tomas was hitting the ball pretty hard."The third seed found back his rhythm in the second set, taking a 3-0 lead after the first three games. However, the former China Open runner-up accomplished a break back after Berdych sent a forehand long, and then held his serve game to level the score to 4-4.The ninth game of the second set turned out to be the most dangerous set for Berdych. Cilic, who saw the hope of taking the title, got himself two break points in the game.However, Berdych wasn't beaten by the huge pressure. He delivered a couple of powerful serves and sealed the most important point of the set. Cilic failed in his own service game after the score went to 5-4, seeing his 3-year-older opponent to claim the second set 6-4."I think the key moment was a break when it was 5-4, Marin was serving. I made a set point and just won the second set," said Berdych.Berdych got rejuvenated in the final set, knocking down five straight games to put an end to the more than two hour match.Compared with Berdych, Radwanska was more familiar with the feeling of lifting a trophy. The 22-year-old downed Vera Zvonareva of Russia to take the WTA Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament on Oct. 1.Radwanska experienced a 154-minute battle to disarm German world No. 11 Andrea Petkovic 7-5, 0-6, 6-4 to seal her 11th straight WTA win and second title in a row. It was also the first Crown Jewel victory ever for Radwanska.At the awarding ceremony, Radwanska and Petkovic performed a short Chinese dance in the newly built 15,000-seat "Diamond Court". And Petkovic, who was plagued by injury all through the match, burst into tears and buried her face into the towel after the dance."She did a great job today. I was scared when I got hurt during the match, but the doctor said it's no problem," said Petkovic. "She deserved the title."Radwanska fired four aces through the match, while her opponent only got one. Neither player was efficient in holding their serves, Radwanska lost eight of them, and Petkovic dropped six.The match remained tight from the very beginning. After the two sides tied at 5-5, Radwanska knocked down two straight games to wrap up the first set 7-5.Petkovic wasn't exhausted by the 84-minute first set. She made use of the mistakes from the other side of the court, keeping Radwanska at love to move into the final set.Breaking became the theme of the third set. Radwanska succeed three times, while Petkovic broke twice. Petkovic made a fatal forehand error to lose the ninth set to her rival, and Radwanska held serve to harvest the victory 6-4.The China Open, which ran in its eighth year, was plagued by a string of pullouts including world No. 1 Nivak Djokovic, Maria Sharapova and the Williams sisters, all with a vast fan base in China.As the matches went on, the WTA and ATP joint tennis tournament was further hit by early exits of big names like French Open champion Li Na, Wimbledon titlist Petra Kvitova and reigning US Open champ Samantha Stosur, which are definitely disasters for the box office."There is no doubt that we were all disappointed to miss players like Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, Serena and Venus (Williams). It is really a bad luck for China Open," said Stacey Allaster, WTA Chairwoman and CEO, in an early interview with Xinhua."Maria has a very severe sprain in Tokyo on last Thursday night, just on the eve of coming to the China Open. And all of those four athletes have reasons outside of their control that make them unable to play here. Hopefully, we have better fortune next year," Allaster added.Apart from the bad luck, the Canadian also admitted that although WTA has been working to cut short the calendar, a still busy schedule had led to the sluggish performance of big names in China Open."Even though we have made some improvements, it was a long season. Without denial, its long," said Allaster. "I think at this time of the year, the athletes have played a lot of matches."Â
