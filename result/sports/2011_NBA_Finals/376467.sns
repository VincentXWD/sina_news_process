The Miami Heat walked away with a slim victory over the Mavericks winning 88-86 in the NBA Finals Game 3 in Dallas.  With the series tied 1-1, the victory gives Miami a 2-1 and returns home court advantage.  The end of the game wasn't pretty with both teams shooting 1-5 in the closing 1:40 of a tie game. Miami Heat Chris Bosh broke the tie by taking an assist from Lebron James and nailing an open 16 footer with 39 seconds remaining.  The Mavericks would then take the opportunity to tie with Dirk Nowitzki's fadeaway shot, but the ball bounced out giving the Heat a victory in a silent American Airlines Center arena.   Nowitzki finished the game with 34 points while Miami's Dwayne Wade scored 29 points. Dallas will now try to even the series in their next home game and avoid a 3-1 hole.
