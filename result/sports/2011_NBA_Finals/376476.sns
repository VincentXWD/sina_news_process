LeBron says winning will take care of his legacy

DALLAS - LeBron James bristled Monday at the idea his offensive prowess in the NBA Finals has been a disappointment and that his unwillingness to take charge down the stretch could ultimately affect his legacy.The Miami Heat forward has averaged a modest 20.3 points and has been largely absent on offense in the fourth quarter but his team holds a 2-1 lead over the Dallas Mavericks.James says all he wants to do is win."Anybody that knows me throughout the years, all I care about is the W," he said. "I'm not just a scoring guy. I've got a lot of points in my career."I have had some team mates who have given me great confidence and ability to go out there and score a lot of points. But I've done other things."I don't have to score points to be effective."James, seeking his first NBA title, said he has no problem letting his team mates shoulder the scoring burden in the fourth quarter if they have the open shots.The two-time MVP and former scoring champion said he did not have to sink the winning shot to help the Heat beat the Mavericks 88-86 on Sunday in Dallas.Chris Bosh provided the winning margin on a 16-foot jump shot with 39.6 seconds left and the Heat held on to restore their home-court advantage in the best-of-seven series."Not only did Chris Bosh make the game winning shot, but (Dwyane) Wade had a hockey assist," said James. "I got the assist to CB and Udonis Haslem set the screen on (Dallas's Dirk Nowitzki) to get him a wide open shot."That's what it's about. This is a team game."James, who had only two of his 17 points in the final quarter, snapped at a reporter who suggested he was failing to live up to his lofty status by not taking control with the clock winding down."I think you're concentrating on one side of the floor," he said on Sunday during the post-game news conference. "All you're looking at is the stat sheet. Honestly, I'm a two way player."Since D Wade had it going offensively, we allow him to handle the ball, bring it on offensively."You should watch the film again and see what I did defensively. You'll ask me a better question tomorrow."A day later, James said he was not concerned about his legacy."I just want to win," he told reporters. "My individual stats will take care of itself. In a series I've averaged 38 points a game and we've lost in the Eastern Conference Finals against Orlando."This is a team game. My resume will speak for itself after I'm done with this game of basketball. What me and my team mates are trying to accomplish now is the only thing I'm worried about."When I'm done, I'll let you guys figure where I should be placed."
