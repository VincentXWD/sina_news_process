MIAMI â€“ The NBA says it will review further the altercation between the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks in the second quarter of Game 6 after some players from the bench were on the floor.Players leaving the bench during an altercation are subject to an automatic one-game fine, but no players were thrown out Sunday night because the incident came during a timeout, when players had already left the bench area."A player will not automatically be suspended for leaving the bench if he has already left the bench because a timeout was called," league spokesman Tim Frank says in a statement. "However, we need to review the circumstances of this particular incident, which we will do, after the game."The teams were headed to a timeout when the Mavs' DeShawn Stevenson objected to Udonis Haslem being in his path. Shoving ensued, and the Heat's Joel Anthony, who was not in the game at the time, rushed into the scrum.(Agencies)
