NEW YORK, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Rafael Nadal crushed 29-year-old Andy Roddick on Friday, setting up a quarterfinal clash against World No. 4 Andy Murray as the Scottish eliminated another American John Isner.Considering the other two players having advanced into last four on Thursday are top seed Novak Djokovic and third seed Swiss Roger Federer, it will be for the second time this year, the top four seeded men have advanced to the semifinals at a Grand Slam event as it also happened at the French Open."It seems like top four players are doing well. That's the thing. Top four are very solid here. The previous years too, my opinion," said Nadal."For last few years top four players are very solid in almost every tournament. That's difficult to to see that in the past because that's very difficult. Tennis is a very competitive sport, so I think is very good news for tennis."We have a little bit this extra advantage, and we are doing well. I think the rest of the players feel that they can win, too, but that did not happen this year."The second-seeded Nadal met little resistance from the top American player as the Spaniard converted six of seven break points to beat Roddick, who won the 2003 Open title, 6-2, 6-1, 6-3 through a quick 1 hour, 53 minutes.Nadal will play fourth-seeded Murray on Saturday in the second semifinal after top-seeded Novak Djokovic meets third-seeded Roger Federer.Djokovic is 62-2 with nine titles in 2011, including at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. His first loss this season came when Federer ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak in a thrilling French Open semifinal. His second came from the Cincinnati Masters final as the Serb retired trailing 6-4, 3-0 against Murray quoting shoulder injury.Roddick never broke his opponent and committed 25 unforced errors, 12 more than the Spaniard. The 25-year-old Nadal played more aggressive tennis, hitting 35 winners, overwhelming Roddick's 15.In an earlier match, Murray dealt with No. 28 Isner's big serve and used a variety of lobs and pinpoint passing shots to win 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (2), reaching his fourth major semifinal this season.For the third straight major, Nadal and Murray will play each other in the semifinals. Nadal beat Murray in straight sets at the French Open and in four sets at Wimbledon.Roddick received medical treatment on his left thigh twice during the match but when Nadal broke Roddick's serve in the very first game it was an indication that Roddick had no weapons to hurt Nadal, who made the semifinals at the Open for the fourth straight year.Murray echoed Nadal's argument suggesting the sport benefits when the top four men compete at the end of a major."I think it's good for tennis," Murray said. "What people would like to see would be for you to play your best tennis here."Wimbledon just missed having the top four when Jo-Wilfried Tsonga upset Federer in the quarterfinals, and David Ferrer upset Nadal in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open to keep the top four out of the semis in Melbourne.Murray, one of tennis' top returners, weathered 17 aces at up to 140 mph from the 6-foot-9 Isner but repeatedly got back serves topping 130 mph and managed to break the American twice in a row bridging the first two sets."It's so frustrating playing against him because you feel like you're playing good tennis, and it's so hard to break him," Murray said.While Murray is a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, Isner was playing in his first quarterfinal at a major tournament.Murray's past Grand Slam final appearances include losses to Djokovic at the Australian Open in January and to Federer at the US Open in 2008. He's seeking to become the first British man since 1936 to win a Grand Slam title.Murray is now only the seventh man in the Open era to reach at least the semifinals at all four Grand Slam tournaments in a single season. Three of the others are Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.To date, Isner is best known for winning the longest match in tennis history, 70-68 in the fifth set in Wimbledon's first round in 2010, when he pounded 113 aces over its record 11 hours, 5 minutes.
