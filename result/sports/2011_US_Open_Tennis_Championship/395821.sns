NEW YORK, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Rafael denied Andy Murray's search for a first Grand Slam with a tough four-set victory over the British top player, setting up a US Open final clash against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on Saturday for the second consecutive year.Second seed Nadal beat fourth seed Murray 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 in a semifinal lasting three hours, 24 minutes.In the other semifinal, Roger Federer couldn't convert on two match points while serving in the fifth set and, for the second year in a row, the five-time US Open champion was beaten by Djokovic in the last four.The 24-year-old Djokovic, who is 63-2 on the year, won the epic clash with Federer,6-7 (7), 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 in three hours, 51 minutes.Playing his third match in three days at the rain-drenched Open, Nadal lost his first set of the tournament, but broke Murray twice in the fourth set to reach his 14th Grand Slam final.Last year, Nadal beat Djokovic in four sets in the final, but this year, Djokovic is 5-0 in the head-to-head matchup, with all five wins coming in tournament finals.In reaching the last four, Murray joined an elite band of seven players to have reached the semifinals of all four grand slams in a calendar year.Murray was not without chances, as he rallied superbly to take the third set and had Nadal rattled in the fourth, only to surrender his serve in weak fashion which allowed the 25-year-old Spaniard to close out the victory.Nadal came out determined to impose himself on Murray and hit a couple of big forehands, but Murray produced some high-class serving to hold.Nadal broke through in the seventh game with a deep forehand that drew the error, taking the firs set in 55 minutes.Murray had break points at the start of the second set and had a look at second serves. Nadal, though, steeled himself and came through an eight-minute game.A love hold moved Nadal two sets to the good, but Murray came out fighting at the start of third and a blistering point in which he won a baseline battle earned him a break of serve.Murray duly dropped his serve immediately after breaking, with his first double fault of the match and a shocking backhand allowing Nadal to get back on track.Murray's level was much improved in the third set and a brilliant series of points enabled him to break Nadal for a second time to lead 5-3. And on this occasion Murray did not surrender his advantage and he served out to cut the deficit.The world No. 2 secured the cushion of a three-game lead in the fourth set when holding for 4-1. Murray staved off three break points to go down a double break but it failed to spark a revival as Nadal closed out the match to set up a meeting with Djokovic in Monday's final.
