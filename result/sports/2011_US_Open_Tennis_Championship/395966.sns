SYDNEY, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- Samantha Stosur becomes the first Australian woman in 31 years to win a grand slam title, defeating American Serena Williams with an emphatic 6-2, 6-3 victory in the U.S. Open women' s final, local media reported on Monday.The 27-year-old from Australia's Queensland overcame Williams in New York on Monday morning to become Australia's first women's major winner since Evonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.Stosur produced the match of her life against Williams in front of a 23,000 strong crowd at Arthur Ashe stadium, emphatically taking down Williams 6-2, 6-3 in 1 hour and 23 minutes."I had one of my best days and I'm very fortunate that I had it on this stage in New York," Stosur said."Ever since I started playing it was a dream of mine to be here one day."Stosur, who will move to seventh in the world after the triumph, said her defeat in the final of the French Open in 2010 served her well on the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium."To be honest I was feeling quite relaxed compared to my last grand slam final, so maybe that helped having that experience," she told Australia's leading sports broadcaster Fox Sports."To come out here and play as well as I did it's just an unbelievable feeling, especially to beat Serena on this court. I don't even know how to describe it."
