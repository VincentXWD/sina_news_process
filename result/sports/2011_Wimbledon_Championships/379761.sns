LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Serbian star Novak Djokovic will become the newly-crowned world No. 1 on Monday after beating Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the men's singles semifinals at the Wimbledon Championships on Friday."It feels amazing. When I finished the match, I didn't know how to show my emotions," said the second seed Djokovic, who outplayed the 12th seed Tsonga 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-7(9), 6-3 to grab a Wimbledon final berth for the first time.Djokovic was broken in the first game by Tsonga, who fought back from two sets down to stun six-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. But the 24-year-old Serb came back with a break in the 10th game and won the tiebreak 7-4 in the opening set.Djokovic played more aggressively to break twice in the second set and didn't lose his momentum after an intense third-set loss. With a break in the second game in the fourth set, Djokovic managed to celebrate the victory by lying on the grass court."It's definitely one of the most important achievements and days in my life, in my career. We are all dedicated to this sport a hundred percent. When you know your're going to be the best in the world and you're reaching the finals of your favourite tournament. It's something special," said Djokovic, who will meet defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final who defeated British top player Andy Murray.Djokovic also becomes the first player other than Nadal or Federer to grasp the world No. 1 spot since February 2004.
