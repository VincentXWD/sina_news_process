LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Novak Djokovic of Serbia claimed his first Wimbledon title on Sunday after beating defending champion Rafael Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3.The serb, who will take over the world top ranking from the Spaniard on Monday, extended his mastery over Nadal this season with a fifth straight head-to-head victory.It was Djokovic's first title at the All England Club and third major championship overall. He crouched on Center Court, reached down, put some grass into his mouth."I felt like an animal. I wanted to see how it tastes. It tastes good," Djokovic said. "It came spontaneously, really. I didn't plan to do it. I didn't know what to do for my excitement and joy."Djokovic assured himself of the No. 1 ranking just by reaching the final."I managed to achieve a lifetime goal and I managed to make my dream come true, all in three days' time," said Djokovic, who tossed three of his rackets into the crowd. "It's just an incredible feeling that I'm never going to forget. This is the best day of my tennis career.""He played better than me," said Nadal, the 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon champion. "For that reason, he is the champion here."Djokovic dominated the first two sets easily with his incredible movement and precise shot placement. His play dipped in the third, but it returned in the fourth to secure him a third Grand Slam title.They traded service breaks early in the fourth set. But after Djokovic held to 4-3 in the final set with four straight points, Nadal double-faulted for the first time. He lost the next two points and soon was broken again when he sent a backhand long."He's doing great. He's doing a few things fantastic," Nadal said. "But I had to play better to win, and I didn't today. I played little bit less aggressive."The loss to Djokovic on Sunday was Nadal's first in a major final to a player other than Federer.
