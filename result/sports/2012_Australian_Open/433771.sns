MELBOURNE, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Kei Nishikori became the first Japanese man to reach the Australian Open fourth round here on Saturday after defeating Frenchman Julien Benneteau 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-3.The 24th-seeded Japanese, who also reached the fourth round of U.S. Open in 2008, had a three-hour 25-minute match to book a perth in the top 16.Nishikori was broken twice in the first set as Benneteau drew first blood, but he held his nerve to win two consecutive tiebreaks before also taking the fourth set.The key to the match, said Nishikori, was coming back from a perilous position in the third set."That was a really tough moment for me because I was up a break in the first and second sets, and he came back. Third set he was 5-2 up. You know, it was so many ups and down. Mentally it wasn't easy," said Nishikori.The 22-year-old Japanese reached two finals and beat world No.1 Novak Djokovic in 2011, to become the highest-ranked Japanese man in history. His current world ranking is No. 26.Nishikori is also the first Japanese man to take an ATO tour title in 16 years when he won at Delray Beach in 2008.Nishikori's next round opponent will be sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, whom he beat in Shanghai last year."Tsonga is really aggressive. He has a great serve and comes to the net a lot," said Nishikori. "But I'm excited to get through here, round of 16. That's my best result right now in a grand slam. Yeah, I want to win the next one."
