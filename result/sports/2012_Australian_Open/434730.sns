Â Victoria Azarenka of Belarus celebrates her victory over Kim Clijsters of Belgium in their women's singles semi-final match at the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 26, 2012. (Xinhua/Bai Xue)MELBOURNE, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Victoria Azarenka reached her first Grand Slam final, surviving a second set fight by defending champion Kim Clijsters to claim a 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 win on Thursday at the Australian Open."Aussie Kim", who claimed the title a year before by beating Chinese top player Li Na, enjoyed more enthusiastic crowds support than Azarenka, but she could not catch up the movement of the 22-year-old Belarussian on court and conceded the match in two hours and 12 minutes.Azarenka, who could be world No.1 when the new rankings are released on Monday after Caroline Wozniacki was eliminated, will clash against the winner of the other semifinal between fourth seed Maria Sharapova and second seed Petra Kvitova later on Thursday.Azarenka had a better start to the match, keeping Clijsters pinned back behind the baseline and grabbing an early break in the third game.Clijsters set up immediate break back points but could not take advantage of any of them, including four in a row in the fourth set, as Azarenka held to consolidate before riding her break to claim the first set in the 10th game.The noisy crowd in the Rod Laver Arena saw a completely different match in the second set. Clijsters produced a lot of great ground-strokes, both in forehands and backhands, to keep Azarenka out of game and secure the break in just the second game.It was Clijsters' last appearance in the Australian Open as she always vowed. As Clijsters' game improved, Azarenka was clearly nervous. Her first serve percentage in the second set dipped to a woeful 35% and she threw in 16 unforced errors.The Belgian totally dominated the match in the second set after she took it 6-1 and early in the third. The 11th seed faced an early break point in the first game of the third set after Azarenka lost with a forehand unforced error.But Clijsters lost it and everything changed after that.After holding the first serve and breaking in the second, the Belarussian clearly re-established her self-confidence. Clijsters got the match back on serve at 3-4, but Azarenka broke again and with the match in her grasp and earned a 5-3 lead before the ninth game on her own serve.Leading at 40-0, Azarenka threw in a double fault to waste her first match point, but a return long from Clijsters handed her the victory before Azarenka fell to the ground in triumph.The Belarusian's best grand slam result before was reaching the semi-finals at last year's Wimbledon before this tournament.
