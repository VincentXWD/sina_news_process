The Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London due to kick off on Friday, July 27th, promises to become one the most spectacular in the history of sport.The ceremony, dubbed “Isles of Wonder”, will feature a series of exciting performances, including a special sequence combining scenes from agrarian Britain with a look back on the country’s history.Directed by Oscar winner Danny Boyle, the Opening Ceremony will also showcase a “historical parade” with scenes that reflect the current state of affairs in the areas of immigration and economy.The $42mln extravaganza will be accompanied by faked pouring rain, footages from the Glastonbury Festival, a cricket game, and the sound of Europe’s largest harmonically tuned bell, which weighs 23 tons.The three-hour spectacle will wind up with the Beatles song “Hey Jude” which will be performed by Beatles legend Paul McCartney.A record number of 125,000 arrivals, including an estimated 2,000 athletes coaches, officials and journalists from all over the world poured into Heathrow Airport on Thursday for the London Olympics, which kick off later today.To cope with the deluge, Heathrow, officially designated as London’s Olympic airport, has enlisted some 1,000 volunteers to greet arrivals and opened a special "Games Lane" for Olympic officials, VIPs and athletes.A special terminal will open at the close of the Games to handle the outgoing members of the Olympic family.(Agencies)
