LONDON, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Dong Dong, the 2009 and 2010 world champion, won the men's trampoline gold medal of the Olympic Games with a prevailing 62.990 points on Friday.Russia's Dmitry Ushakov was 1.221 points trailing to win a silver medal and the defending Olympic champion Lu Chunlong of China settled with the bronze in 61.319 points.Dong set the pace at the qualifications with 112.895 points out of two routines and Ushakov was also in second with Lu in third. The top three places remained the same in the finals.Dong presented a much more tough routine in the final of 17.800 difficulty point, which gave him the cutting edge over Ushakov and Lu, whose routines were both executed soundly, but both in 17.100 difficulty."I learned a lot from my last Olympics experience," said 23-year-old Dong, who was the bronze medalist in Beijing."Four years ago, I feel so nervous when I stood on the Olympic stage and it seemed to me the sky was falling, but now in London, I am composed all through the match, even when I saw the Russian competitor demonstrated a impressive routine."You need to face a lot of pressure if you come up to compete last, but I learned what I experienced four years ago," added Dong.Talking about the finals' routine decision, Dong said: "I have a routine of 7.100 difficulty and another 7.800, but I won't step back from the tough one for the sake of pressure. I think that's what I made during the last four years. I'm tough now."Canada's Jason Burnett failed to finish his action after he fell on the boundary. Both Japanese trampolinists Masaki Ito and Yasuhiro Ueyama made errors on center bound control and finally finished in fourth and fifth places.For Ushakov, it's a day to celebrate for his podium finish. "My emotions are only positive. I have never been in the top three in a championships before so I'm happy to finally achieve what I've been training for," said the Russian, who was placed sixth at Beijing Olympics and fifth at 2009, 2010 worlds."I came here for a medal and I knew what the pressure would be. It played a role for Nikita (Fedorenko, Ushakov's teammate). I wish he could have done better, but he has a big future ahead of him."For China's Lu, it's a little bit disappointment for a bronze. Lu was in tear after the medal ceremony, half for disappointment and half for his departure from the Olympic stage."My body situation won't allow me to continue the sport," said Lu, who revealed a injury in his spine and Lumbar vertebrae."When you know you're going to say good bye to the Olympic stage, you can't control your emotion. I know it'll be my last and I'm emotional today."
