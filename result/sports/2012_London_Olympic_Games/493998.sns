LONDON, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese gymnast Feng Zhe held his nerve to win the Olympic men's parallel bars gold medal here on Tuesday.It was the third title claimed by the Chinese gymnastics team at the London Games. The Asian powerhouse also won gold medals in men's team and women's beam events.As the third one to compete, Feng was under much pressure after teammate Zhang Chenglong fell off the apparatus. But the 2010 world champion in the discipline managed to earn a highest score of 15.955 points.Marcel Nguyen of Germany was 0.166 points behind and took the silver. The bronze went to French Hamilton Sabot who scored 15.566 points."We finally vented out our frustration," said Feng. "Our skills are outstanding, but it is hard to say whether our performances are to the taste of the judges. This is the problem for all the events whose results are determined by judges."Feng referred to the scoring controversy in Monday's rings final, where teammate Chen Yibing had looked assured of victory after a superb opening routine only to final Arthur Nabarrete Zanetti of Brazil pull off a shock by earning the highest score."I felt sorry for Chen, but he did his best," said Feng, who has many fans in China for his baby-faced looks and sense of humor."It tells how cruel sport competition is. I just need to do my best here," he added.Nguyen said he was fairly satisfied with his silver medal, though he had a slight glitch with the grip and didn't dismount properly."This is the best thing I have ever had in life," he said. "I will never forget them."Japanese Tanaka Kazuhito and Tanaka Yasuke brothers, whose parents are both gymnasts as well, finished fourth and eighth respectively in men's parallel bars final.
