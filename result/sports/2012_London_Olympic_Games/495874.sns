RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil men's volleyball coach Bernardinho has taken the blame for his team's 3-2 capitulation to Russia in Saturday's Olympic final.Brazil won the first two sets 25-19, 25-20 and twice served for the match in the third only to see the Russians snatch gold by taking the final three sets 29-27, 25-22, 15-9."I'm sorry, I really lost the match," Bernardinho told Terra. "I am very frustrated because we were so close to the gold medal."Several players like Giba, Rodrigao and Serginho are retiring and they didn't deserve to go out this way."Bernardinho has coached the Brazil men's team for the past 12 years and led the side to the 2004 gold medal in Athens.The runner-up placing in London was Brazil's second consecutive Olympic silver medal after a 3-1 loss to the USA in Beijing final four years ago."We have to learn how to win and lose," Bernardinho said. "We have won a lot more than we have lost but losing is part of the game."
