MOSCOW, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Olympic silver medalist Tatiana Kashirina said on Thursday that it was "decent" for her to take the second place following Chinese weightlifter Zhou Lulu in London."The Chinese weightlifter is really stronger but I have approached her already. She is heavier, and has more experience," Kashirina told local sports media.Still, the 21-year-old Russian girl said, she breathed down Zhou's neck, with 332 kg vs 333 kg results in two attempts.Kashirina reminded that in the World Championship she lifted a weight seven kilograms less than Zhoul did. In London the difference was narrowed to one kilogram only."I have no goal to catch up with her. I intend simply to improve my own results," the athlete said, who cried in London after winning the second.Her coach Vladimir Krasnov noted that Kashirina set three world and four Olympic records in the class of over 75 kg."She performed brilliantly, but this time the Chinese was stronger," Krasnov said.The Russian was ahead of her Chinese competitor in the first attempt (151 kg vs 146 kg) but Zhou outperformed in the second attempt (187 vs 181).
