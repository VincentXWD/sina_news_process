By Li Hongmei, Sina EnglishSouth Korean soccer player Park Jong-soo blatantly violated the Olympic charter by waving a nationalist propaganda sign after his team defeated Japan to win a bronze medal in the just concluded London Olympics.In a desperate attempt to downplay the incident, South Koreans have tried to find Japanese violations of the prohibition on political statements at the Olympics. One major South Korean newspaper is whining about the “rising sun flag” on Japan’s gymnastics uniforms:Japan is the “land of the rising sun” and so both its national flag and its naval ensign currently use sun symbols. The same symbol is also used as a corporate logo by the Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning Japanese newspaper.Even when Japanese usage of the sun/rising sun symbols predates Japanese colonialism/fascism, Korean nationalists have attempted to equate it with Nazi Germany’s use of the swastika.Related news:S.
