The 2012 Summer Paralympic Games will be the fourteenth Paralympics and will take place between 29 August and 9 September. They will be held in London, United Kingdom, after the city was successful with its bid for the Paralympics and Summer Olympic Games. It is the second largest multi-sport event ever held within the United Kingdom after the 2012 Olympic Games.The Games will be the first modern Paralympics solely hosted by the United Kingdom; the 1984 Summer Paralympics were originally intended to be hosted by the United States at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, but due to financial issues, the university passed on hosting the games shortly before they were set to begin, leading to the British village of Stoke Mandeville and the American region of Long Island quickly stepping in to co-host the games. Stoke Mandeville also played an important role in the history of the Paralympics; in 1948, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann and the Stoke Mandeville Hospital first held the Stoke Mandeville Games, an event for British World War II veterans with spinal cord injuries to coincide with the opening ceremony of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. The Stoke Mandeville Games were the first ever organised athletics event for the disabled, and served as a significant precursor to the Paralympic movement as a whole.The Games will offically be opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. This will be the first time that the Paralympic Games have been opened by the Queen, because when Britain co-hosted the Games in 1984 it was Prince Charles who did the duty.(Agencies)
