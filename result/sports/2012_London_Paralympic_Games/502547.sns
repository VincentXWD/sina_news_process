LONDON, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian sprinters broke Paralympic records Sunday, the fourth day of competition at the London 2012 Paralympic Games.Terezinha Guilhermina set a new Paralympic record in the women's T11 200-meter race with a time of 24.82 seconds.On the podium, Guilhermina was accompanied by fellow Brazilian sprinters Jerusa Geber, who clocked 26.32 seconds for the silver medal, and third-placed Jhulia Santos.Later in the day, sprinter Yohansson Nascimento took gold after setting a world record in the men's T46 200-meter race in 22.05 seconds.Cuba's Raciel Gonzalez Isidoria won silver in 22.15 seconds and Australian Simon Patmore got bronze in 22.16.Nascimento celebrated his win by holding up a sign for the TV cameras that said "Thalita, will you marry me?", apparently proposing to his girlfriend in front of the cheering crowds.After a few minutes, Brazil's TVSport channel linked the two by phone, so his girlfriend could respond, which she did, with a "Yes."The T46 classification designates athletes with upper limb deficiencies.
