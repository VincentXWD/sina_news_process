A colorful "Festival of Flame" ceremony at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford brings to an end the Paralympic Games in London. A “storm” whirls onto the stage where the athletes are assembled, carrying away into the sky the Paralympic Symbol consisting of three asymmetrical half-moon elements in red, blue and green.Following that, dozens of vehicles, including trucks in the form of fish, clocks, a grasshopper and a locomotive converge upon the stage. All the action unfolds to the music by famous British rock band Coldplay, which prepared a special program for the ceremony.The event features "overseas" surprise guests - singer Rhianna and rapper Jay-Z. Themes include the seasons of the year, and modern and ancient festivals.The Paralympics 2012 brought the Chinese team 231 medals, including 95 gold.
