However Thailand came from behind to clinch three victories in a row.Singles player Porntip Buranaprasertsuk and Sapsiree Taerattanachai both won in three close sets, while doubles pair Saralee Thoungthongkam/Kunchala Voravichitchaikul scored the winning point with an easy 2-0 victory.Thailand will face host China in Thursday's Uber Cup semifinals. "Thailand is strong and young, they have played so many big events, but our players are less experienced," said world No. 7 Baun.Another veteran Peter Gade helped to fly the flag for Denmark at the Thomas Cup, leading the team to beat underdog Russia at ease.Gade met a bit difficulties in the first set against tall Russian opponent Vladimir Ivanov, but managed to win 21-18, 21-13."It's a bit strange to play against him as I haven't played with him before. Anyway I feel good, my legs are getting better and better," said Gade."I didn't play a match yesterday because of Chong Wei's injury. It's nice to get playing today."World No. 1 Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia suffered an ankle injury in Tuesday's match against Gade, putting his participation in the London Olympic Games in doubt.Gade sympathized with Lee's injury. "What happened to Chong Wei is what all of us don't want to do. Injury also threatens myself. It's a very tough season with the Olympics and when you are 35 years old, you have to be more careful."Denmark will face the winner between Germany and South Korea in the semifinals.
