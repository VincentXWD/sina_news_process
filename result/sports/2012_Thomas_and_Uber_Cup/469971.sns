In the next two sets, Lin played confidently and took an early lead to win the first match for China 17-21, 21-9, 21-5."Lee's withdrawal definitely affected Malaysia, but Liew is a young promising player," said Lin."I have made full preparation for possible difficulties, so I quickly made adjustment in the next two sets."World No. 1 Cai Yun/Fu Haifeng enlarged China's lead by outclassing Malaysia's Koo Kien Keat/Tan Boon Heong 21-17, 21-18.
