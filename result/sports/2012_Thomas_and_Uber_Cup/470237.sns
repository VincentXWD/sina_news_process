Chinese world No 1 Wang Yihan sweat it out to take Karin Schnaase but China ironed Germany 3-0 in Uber Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday.With Juliane Schenko focusing on Olympics and Olga Konon suffering from her injuries, Karin Schnaase didn't freeze her feet against Wang."I was normally number three in Germany, so fighting against Wang makes me feels like 'Oh My God!'" said the world number 59 Schnaase, "Everyone knows China is the best in badminton, so it's great to play badminton in China against Chinese player."Schnaase forced Wang stumbled over numbers of baseline errors throughout their first-ever match. Wang managed to gear back with strong smashing to edge over Schnaase 21-15 and 21-17 after 48 minutes.According to Schnaase, German top women's single shuttler Juliane Schenko will compete in next month's Superseries Premier Indonesia Open, so the German coach team decided to "give young players some time and experience".Wang's teammate, world number two Wang Xin nailed down China's semifinal berth by occupying her game against Carola Bott at two straight 21-7, after women's double Wang Xiaoli/Yu Yang suppressed Carla Nelte/Isabel Herttrich's retrieval at 21-10, 19-21 and 21-8.China will face the winner between Thailand and Denmark in Thursday's semifinals.
