WUHAN, China, May 24 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Wang Yihan said here on Thursday she's dying to regain the Uber Cup back from South Korea.Wang, 24, fended off the challenge from three-time world junior champion Inthanon Ratchanok of Thailand, winning 21-18, 21-15."We've prepared two years for the Uber Cup and we want this trophy more than anything else," said Wang, who lost the opening singles match in Kuala Lumpur two years ago.After China's waterloo defeat, Wang lived under the shadow for almost six months, she said."It was a big blow to me, sending me from heaven to hell," Wang recalled.Wang recovered from her slump with shining performances in Malaysia and South Korea in 2011 and went on to win the world singles title.Ratchanok, who spearheaded Thailand into the semifinals, has won the world top player's respect."Ratchanok is strong and known for her unpredictable variation of shots. She is hard to fight against," said Wang. "Fortunately, I handled the pressure very well today."Ratchanok, 17, said she was happy to write a new chapter of history for Thailand, as they were the first ever Thai team in the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup last four.
