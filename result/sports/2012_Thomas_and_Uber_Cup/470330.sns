WUHAN, China, May 24 (xinhua) -- Eleven-time Uber Cup winner China trounced Thailand on Thursday night to peg a revenge clash against the reigning champion South Korea.World No.1 Wang Yihan, a self-claimed "culprit" in China's 3-1 Uber Cup final loss in 2010, fended off three-time world junior champion Inthanon Ratchanok 21-18, 21-15."We've prepared two years for the Uber Cup and we want this trophy more than anything else," said Wang, who lost the opening singles match in Kuala Lumpur two years ago.Ratchanok, 17, said she was happy to write a new chapter of history for Thailand, as they were the first ever Thai team in the Thomas Cup or Uber Cup last four.Yu Yang/Wang Xiaoli stamped their authority over Duanganong Aroonkesorn/ Kunchala Voravichitchaikul, winning 21-16, 21-12. Wang Xin eased through Pornip Buranaprasertsuk 21-17, 21-2.Just like what China had been longing for, South Korea spoilt Japan's dream for a spot in the final by winning three straight matches in the afternoon semifinal.After surviving the nail-biting six-hour marathon against Indonesia last night, Japan felt that it was unfair that they had to play an afternoon semifinal after a night quarter-final."It's better for us if we can compete in the night or have one day to rest," said Japan's head coach Park Joo Bong. "The tight schedule made it tough for us and South Korea. It's unfair."Chinese head coach Li Yongbo shrugged off Park's complaint and said that it was not necessary to mourn the loss."Both Japanese and South Korean players should be happy because they had been through a big test," Li said. "I would be very happy if our players experience some painful moments that will make them stronger and tougher."Sayaka Sato lost her fifth encounter with Ji Hyun Sung of South Korea 21-15, 21-10 as the first singles shuttler.Reika Kakkiwa, who had just five hours sleep last night, and her partner Mizuki Fujii could have won one point to level 1-1 against South Korea in the doubles, but they eventually lost to Min Jung Kim/Jung Eun Ha 13-21, 21-17 and 14-21.Youn Joo Bae sealed the deciding third point for South Korea as she outplayed last year's All-England Open runner-up Eriko Hirose 21-15, 21-17.
