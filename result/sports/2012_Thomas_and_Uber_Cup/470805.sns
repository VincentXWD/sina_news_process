WUHAN, China, May 26 (Xinhua) -- "We are the champion!" cried out the whole Chinese team who had a circle dance and hugged each other after winning their 12th Uber Cup trophy.China on Saturday handed a 3-0 defeat to South Korea, which had stunned the Chinese for the title two years ago.World No.1 Wang Yihan, a self-claimed "culprit" in China's 3-1 Uber Cup final loss to the same opponent in 2010, didn't lose a single set at the 2012 Uber Cup until her game against Sung Ji Hyun of South Korea.Taking a 14-12 lead in the first set, Wang slipped into low-battery-mode and allowed Sung grab nine straight points for 21-14."I felt it was like a deja vu when I took a glimpse at the trophy. All those uncomfortable memories flooded back," recalled Wang in the press conference. "But I didn't give up. Never, ever."Wang managed four straight match points to win the second set 22-20 and swept the third set 21-13."It's a milestone for me: now I can proudly say that I'm over it (the 2010 loss to South Korea," said Wang.Wang said that she even saw Chinese head coach Li Yongbo bursted into tears when she won the precious one point for China. Li laughed off that saying later on.World top women's doubles Yu Yang/Wang Xiaoli sent China one step nearer to the Cup as they breezed through Kim Min Jung/Ha Jung Eun 21-15 and 21-13. Multi Superseries titlist Wang Xin faced no problem in winning over Bae Youn Joo in 21-10, 21-16."We made mistakes last time," commented Li. "But thanks for all our coaches and players' effort in the past two years...I'm expecting another six-title-streak."In 2010, China unexpectedly lost to South Korea in the Uber Cup final, which stopped China from their seventh straight title.
