The Gentlemen's Singles champion receives a silver gilt cup 18.5 inches (about 47 cm) in height and 7.5 inches (about 19 cm) in diameter.The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: "All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World."The Ladies' Singles champion receives a sterling silver salver commonly known as the "Venus Rosewater Dish", or simply the "Rosewater Dish".The salver, which is 18.75 inches (about 48 cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.The winners of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups.The runner-up in each event receives an inscribed silver plate. The trophies are usually presented by the President of the All England Club, The Duke of Kent.Prize money was first awarded in 1968, the first year that professional players were allowed to compete in the Championships.Prior to 2007, among grand slam tournaments, Wimbledon and the French Open awarded more prize money in men's events than in women's events. In 2007, Wimbledon changed this policy, giving the same money for both events.The decision has been controversial as women spend approximately half the amount of time on court as men during the tournament due to them playing only three sets, therefore earning considerably more per hour than their male counterpartsIn 2009, a total of £12,500,000 in prize money was awarded with the singles champions receiving £850,000 each, an increase of 13.3 percent on 2008.For the 2010 Championships, the total prize money increased to £13,725,000, and the singles champions received £1,000,000 each.For the 2011 Wimbledon Championships it has been announced that the total prize money will be £14,600,000 an increase of 6.4% from 2010. Both male and female singles champions prize money will also increase to £1,100,000, a rise of 10% on the previous year.(Wikipedia)
