Brick by brick, Andy Murray chiseled his way through a Spanish wall to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals while Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic simply demolished outclassed opponents on Wednesday to set up a mouth-watering first meeting on grass。Murray endured an afternoon of hard labor against David Ferrer, eventually edging a step closer to becoming Britain's first male singles finalist at the grasscourt slam since 1938 with a grinding 6-7 7-6 6-4 7-6 victory。The fourth seed, who hit back impressively after being a point away from a two-set deficit, has the added bonus of not having to face Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals。With the twice former champion long since departed it will be the imposing frame of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga standing in his way after the Frenchman beat German Philipp Kohlschreiber 7-6 4-6 7-6 6-2.Before Murray's energy-sapping win over seventh seed Ferrer, Federer treated Britain's Prince William, his wife Kate, and a host of former greats such as Andre Agassi and Rod Laver, to a vintage display of shot-making to thrash Mikhail Youzhny。More of a procession than a tennis match, a supreme Federer, bathed in rare shafts of sunshine, won 6-1 6-2 6-2 to record a 14th win in 14 meetings against the unfortunate Russian. Not even some words of comfort from the Royal Box could save Youzhny。"I asked Andre (Agassi) what I should do," said the hapless Youzhny who must have been tempted to scratch the word "help" into the hallowed turf having etched "sorry" into the French Open clay during a beating by Ferrer last month。Defending champion Djokovic had a few anxious moments against Florian Mayer, the second German in the last eight, as he reacquainted himself with outdoor tennis after playing his three previous matches under Centre Court's roof。(Agencies)
