Cadet world champion Eleonora De Marchi of Italy was upset by South Korean Lee Sinhee in the women's epee fencing at the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games on Monday.The Italian was favorite for the title and proved her class in the semifinal by coming back from 10-6 down to defeat Catherine Nixon from the USA 15-11.But Lee had too much for De Marchi in the gold medal contest, securing a 15-13 triumph after a hard-fought bout."I gave it all when I made that comeback in my semifinal bout," said silver medallist De Marchi."And during the gold medal match I was really tired. Anyway, she was better than me on the day because although I knew what I should or shouldn't do, I couldn't manage to see her attacks. Lee is a very strong fencer."Asa Linde picked up Sweden's first fencing medal at a Youth Olympic Games when she beat Nixon 15-8 to collect the bronze."I'm speechless, I'm so happy," Linde said. "I really wanted to bring home a medal. When I lost the semifinal my coach told me 'just take this (focus on the bronze medal) and it worked."In the men's competition, Hungarian Patrik Esztergalyos added the Youth Olympic gold to his cadet world championship, but only after an unconvincing start to the tournament."During the round robin I was stressed and I didn't know why," Esztergalyos said. "I didn't feel the flexibility and form I usually do. My coach told me to start playing differently and step by step, then I thought maybe I could win."The Hungarian improved as the day went on and beat Linus Islas Flygare of Sweden 15-8 in the final, after the Swede had caused an upset by beating world cadet championship runner up America's Justin Yoo in the semifinal."I was expecting someone else in the gold medal match," Esztergalyos said. "I thought I would play Justin, but the Swede beat him in the semifinals so I'm happy about it."The second place is a result Islas Flygare glad to accept. "I'm more satisfied than disappointed. I mean, a big medal like this, the Youth Olympic Games is once in a lifetime," said the Swede."He's a fantastic fencer, you saw it, he won the world championship as well. But fencing is sport and I could have taken it."Ivan Limarev of Russia collected the bronze medal thanks to a 15-14 triumph over Yoo.
