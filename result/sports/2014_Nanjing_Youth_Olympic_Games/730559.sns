Thunder rolled over the courts on the final night of the Youth Olympic Games tennis tournament on Sunday in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, warning of approaching rain, but on the stands there was only thunderous applause.China's Xu Shilin had just won the women's singles gold after a euphoric and unexpected journey to the top.Unseeded Xu defeated sixth seed Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic and fourth seed Slovak Kristina Schmiedlova on her way to the final. Her last challenge was eighth seed Iryna Shymanovich of Belarus, who already had one gold medal from the women's doubles event and was hungry for more.Shymanovich confidently defeated her opponent in the semifinal match, but as a torrential downpour crashed through the courts on Sunday afternoon, delaying the gold-medal match, the Belarusian seemed to have none of this confidence left."I was a little bit nervous," Xu ­admitted later. "My serve was quite off when the match started, but I was able to change that."Shymanovich lost the first set, but rallied and won the first game of the second set. This positive start slipped away from her, however, as Xu tied the set and kept adding points to her score. It was largely a one-sided game from then on."I broke down before I even got to the court," Shymanovich said. "It was hard to play a second final at such a big tournament after yesterday's doubles."Shymanovich struggled to return Xu's passes and did not even attempt reaching for some of them. As the score rose to 4-1, Xu continued to press on the attack while Shymanovich sent the balls flying too high in a bid for extra time."I got a leg injury in the semifinal and practically couldn't move on the court," Shymanovich explained. "But she is a good player and she deserved this victory."The end was anticlimactic. Trailing 5-1 in the second set, with the score tied at 40-40, Shymanovich failed to respond to two serves, which won Xu the match. Xu's greatest ­career success thus far was reaching the quarterfinals in the Wimbledon junior championships."It's just a learning experience," Xu said of her win at a home Youth Olympic Games. "I can take this experience and do better in the future."Lithuanian Akvile Parazinskaite took the bronze medal after a 6-3, 7-5 match against Ukrainian Anhelina Kalinina.
