China's Li Jiaman claimed her second gold medal at the Youth Olympic Games, this time by beating France's Melanie Gaubil 6-5 in the final of the girls' recurve individual event at the Fangshan archery field in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province on Monday.LI, a gold medalist from the mixed international team event on Sunday, made the individual final relatively unopposed.She easily beat Japanese Miasa Koike 6-0 in the quarterfinals and Ana Machado of Brazil 6-2 in the semifinals to set up the tie with her French opponent, who had an equally impressive day.But the final was a different story. Li took the first set by just a point. Gubil had an impressive second set and opened up a three-point lead to win it.Li upped her game in the third and shot two 10's and a nine. Gubil mirrored her opponents score. Both archers shared one point each.Gubil won the fourth set by two points, but Li hit back in the last set with three perfect 10's to take the match to a shoot-off.The Chinese archer maintained her composure in the shoot-off and shot a perfect 10. Gubil's arrow missed the bull's-eye by inches and she managed just nine points and claimed silver."In the shoot-off, I was really nervous and was sweating all over," Li said. "I felt that my parents, all my family members and the entire country were watching me, so I was Â­really nervous. But I took a few seconds and calmed myself down."Gubil said that she tried to approach the Youth Olympic Games much like she approaches any other event."I tried not to think that I'm at the Youth Olympic Games," she said."It was a little difficult, because normally I have rest between matches, but today I tried to rest after each match and be refreshed for the next one," she said, referring to competing thrice in a day.Bronze medalist, Lee Eun-gyeong of South Korea, who broke the qualifying-round world record on the first day of competition, said that she was disappointed with her semifinal show against Gubil."I'm a little bit disappointed because I wanted a medal. But I had a lot of anxiety after getting to the semifinal. This is ok, but I'm just a little bit disappointed.
