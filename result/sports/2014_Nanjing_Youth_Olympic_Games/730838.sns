Volunteers at the Youth Olympic Games say they have learnt a lot from their experience.Monday night witnessed the volunteers celebrating completing their jobs at the Olympic Sports Center. The athletics event culminated on Monday night except for the 8x100 ­meters mixed relay to be staged on Tuesday.Han Bing, a volunteer who dresses up as the mascot Lele every day, said he enjoys his job."I arrive at the stadium around 6:30 every morning, and work till late night," Han said. "Every day I get home at about 12, but I really love it."Han said the steamy weather is not a problem for him, even though obvious sweat can be seen on his forehead through a vent on the mascot costume.Volunteers working outside the main stadium also expressed their positive experiences working at the Games.Xu Mengni, a volunteer on transport line C5, said though she is on a shuttle bus every other day, she found happiness in the job."I meet different people here, it makes me happy," the junior at Jinling Institute of Technology said.Badminton is Xu's favorite sport. The C5 line bus goes through the Nanjing Sport Institute, where the badminton events were held. But Xu said she has no regrets at hardly watching the games, as just being a part of it was a source of pride.Yang Ye, a volunteer of transport assistant who works at the Olympic Sports Center, said her job is a little boring when she has nobody to talk to."It's a little bit boring," Yang admitted. "But I got used to it."Working eight hours a day, one hour standing at the bus stop followed by a one-hour rest period, Yang said handling people's problems at the stop has improved her communication."Frankly speaking, I was a little shy, I didn't speak much to strangers, but this time I have to," Yang said. "After days of working, obviously I changed my habit."Xuan Zhenglin, a volunteer who works at the media center at the Tennis Academy of ­China, said he learned a lot from his job.The 30-year-old said he didn't take much of an interest in sports when he was younger, as he focused on studying, but being a volunteer at the Youth Olympic Games has made him to get to close with sports.He is already considering starting playing sports after the Games, with the "easy sports" of ping-pong and running top of his options.
