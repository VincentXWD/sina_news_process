The 24-year-old asked for medical timeout after the first set on Monday, but still looked struggling in front of the home crowd"I was just trying to find reasons why I should try to play," said Murray. "But there was no real positive sort of coming out and playing because yesterday I was really unhappy on the court.""I never want to pull out of tournaments, especially one of this size. But it's a decision I kind of had to make because I was probably going to do myself more damage," Murray added.Murray will be replaced by world No. 9 Janko Tipsarevic from Serbia.
