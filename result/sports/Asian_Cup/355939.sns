About the AFC Asian Cup

The AFC Asian Cup takes place every four years, having had its first edition in 1956. Since then only seven teams have lifted the title, with a further four managing a runners-up place at best.Saudi Arabia, Japan and Iran have won three titles each, South Korea two, and Kuwait and Iraq one. The remaining team is Israel, which won the 1964 tournament before later joining UEFA and leaving AFC.The earliest tournaments had just four qualifying teams, then later five, followed by six: by 1980 ten teams were able to take part, and while this was temporary decreased to eight, by 1996 there were twelve.The 21st century has brought big changes for the AFC Asian Cup. At China 2004, there were sixteen teams: three years later the tournament was moved to an odd year to allow for a greater spreading of international matches across the world. Thus a selection of South East Asian nations hosted the '07 cup, which was won - surprisingly - by Iraq, who beat Saudi Arabia in the final. South Korea edged Japan for third place.This brings us to Qatar 2011. This is the first time Qatar have hosted the tournament since 1988: then, as now, it will be played in the winter time instead of in the heat of July.
