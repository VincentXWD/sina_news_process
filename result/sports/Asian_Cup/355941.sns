Sixteen teams will play at the AFC Asian Cup of 2011. Of these, four qualified automatically: Qatar as hosts, and Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea as respective first to third finishers in the 2007 edition of the competition.Ten of the remaining twelve qualified through a traditional preliminary round, comprising five groups, each sending one winner and one runner-up to the tournament. The remaining teams qualified by winning the AFC Challenge Cup for emerging footballing nations: there were India in 2008 and North Korea in 2010.Not an expert on the Asian game? Have no fear. Here we bring together brief snippets about each team involved and also name a star player to watch out for. Of course you can find out a lot more in our Asian Cup team profiles to really go in-depth.Group AQatar: Under French boss Bruno Metsu the hosts are in a mixed run of form, but a home field advantage may boost Qatar's chances. They are top seeds due to their hosting the tournament. Star attacker-cum-midfielder Sebastian Soria, born in Uruguay, has a chance to prove himself. Uzbekistan: Central Asia's sleeping giant finished second on goal difference to the UAE during qualifying but know that they are capable of better. There is undoubted pedigree in the team, with former AFC Player of the Year Server Djeparov being one of the many foreign exports - he plays in South Korea. China: Another team that hasn't hit its undoubted potential, China has yet to turn population into power on the football pitch. Indeed, local fans feel that this current squad lacks even the modest pedigree of years past. Key defender Du Wei and company have critics to silence. Kuwait: Perhaps the strongest of all the fourth seeds - North Korea and their World Cup adventure notwithstanding - Kuwait cannot be written off. They generally play a defensive game against better sides, which could frustrate the likes of Uzbeikstan. Bader Al Mutwa is the team's go-to man up front. Group BSaudi Arabia: 2007's second-place finish was a bitter disappointment for the famously passionate Saudi fans - but not as much of a crushing blow as failing to reach the South Africa 2010 World Cup. Still, they're always at their best on Asian soil and will count on the likes of young skipper Yasser Al Qahtani to reach at least the final four. Japan: Hot favourites to progress alongside, or even ahead of Saudi Arabia, Japan have a young, talented and dynamic squad at the disposal of new coach Alberto Zaccheroni, who has gone against the grain by calling for defensive play. Shinji Kagawa was absent from the World Cup but is set to star in this tournament. Jordan: A largely unknown quantity even in West Asia, Jordan are ranked third in the group and will do well to progress. They have an experienced coach in the former of Adnan Hamad but a lack of top-level experience among the Nashama may cost them. Goalkeeper Amer Sabah, one of the stars of Jordan's quarter-final finish in 2004, is the key player. Syria: Even moreso than Jordan, Syria are rank outsiders. They have recently appointed a new coach in the form of Romanian Valeiru Tita, who at least has the advantage of being a veteran of Syrian football. This is an overwhelmingly local-based squad, with skipper and star striker Firas Al Khatib being one of the few successful exports, playing in Kuwait. Group CSouth Korea: That famous East Asian powerhouse is back in an attempt to end their bizarre Asian Cup hoodoo. Believe it or not they haven't won this tournament since 1960. Fans will hope that a largely positive showing in South Africa, coupled with some great young talent, will change all that. Manchester United's on-form Ji-Sung Park is the man to watch.　[1]　[2]　[Next]
