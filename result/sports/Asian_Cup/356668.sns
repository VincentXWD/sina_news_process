DOHAâ€“ Dominant three-time champions Iran cruised past the United Arab Emirates 3-0 at the Asian Cup Wednesday to finish the group stage as the only side with a 100 percent record.Striker Arash Afshin opened the scoring in the 70th minute only to be sent off for a fierce challenge on UAE goalkeeper Majed Naser minutes later.Mohammad Nori doubled their lead on 83 minutes and UAE defender Walid Abbas got an own goal in stoppage time as Team Melli chalked up their third straight win in Group D.Iran were already guaranteed a quarter-final spot against South Korea before the match with wins over Iraq and North Korea, allowing coach Afshin Ghotbi to field four players for the first time in the tournament.He rested Gholam Reza Rezaei, Karim Ansari Fard and Iman Mobali who scored a goal each in the last two matches."I'm very happy about the performance of our players. We had many players for whom it was their first official international match," Ghotbi said. "As a coach, to give them an opportunity was wonderful to do."I think, especially in the second half, we really showed quality."UAE's Slovenian coach Srecko Katenic, whose side ended the group stage without scoring a goal with two defeats in one draw, said: "We were really without five percent of luck."We played very strong in this group. But we must work hard as this is our level today."Iran captain Masoud Shojai almost opened the scoring in the first minute at Qatar Sports Club, but sent his powerfully-hit free kick into Naser's arms.UAE captain Subait Khater, meanwhile, saw his own 30-metre free kick find its way into the hands of Iran goalkeeper Shahab Gordan soon after.On the break in the 18th minute, UAE striker Ismaeli Matar should have scored, trapping a cross on the edge of the box to face the keeper one-on-one, but his right-foot shot swerved toward the near side of the net.The UAE squandered another chance five minutes later when Ahmed Khalil's header bounced short on a goalmouth cross from Khalid Sebil.Iran's offensive machine shifted into gear on the half hour as Nori's left foot unleashed a screamer from the edge of the penalty area but it zipped off the left post.Two minutes later, Ehsan Haji Safi caught a long pass on the right edge of the box and shot through two defenders into the side of the net.Then in the 52nd minute, Reza Rezaei fed a right cross to Mohammad Gholami who slapped the ball too straight to deceive Naser.Naser again responded quickly to deflect Ghasem Hadadifar's one-touch left-foot volley from outside the box on a throw-in on the hour mark before Afshin finally drew first blood on 70 minutes.Mohammad Gholami headed a right cross against the bar and headed the rebound off the bar again. Afshin picked up the ball and slotted in past Naser. His joy didn't last long with Afshin was sent off three minutes later following a violent aerial challenge on the UAE goalkeeper. Iran's second goal came in a flowing attack as Nori latched onto a pass and banged the ball home past Naser. As the clock ticked into stoppage time, Abbas shot into his own net in trying to clear a long ball on an Iranian counter-attack and to make matters worse Khalid Sebil was sent off late on to cap a miserable night for UAE.(Agencies)
