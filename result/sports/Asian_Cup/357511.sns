DOHA - Japan booked a place in the Asian Cup final when they won 3-0 on penalties against arch-rivals South Korea who had snatched an equaliser in the last minute of extra time in an entertaining 2-2 draw on Tuesday.Three-times champions Japan will play the winners of Tuesday's second semi-final between Uzbekistan and Australia at the at the Khalifa Stadium in Saturday's showpiece.Yasuyuki Konno scored the winning penalty on his 28th birthday after Koo Ja-cheol, Lee Yong-rae and Hong Jeong-ho failed to convert South Korea's opening three penalties.The manner of the defeat proved too much for some Koreans who were in tears moments after they celebrated a 120th minute equaliser from Hwang Jae-won to force a shootout.The east Asian rivals produced some of the best football of the tournament in the first 45 minutes at the Al Gharafa Stadium with Japan unlucky not to take the lead.An eye-catching move in the 17th minute set Yuto Nagatomo clear down the left and the fullback's cross found Shinji Okazaki but his powerful header was deflected onto the inside of the post by keeper Jung Sung-ryong who then gathered the ball.Despite the Blue Samurai's fast start it was Korea who took the lead five minutes later from the penalty spot in somewhat fortunate circumstances.Konno was judged to have blocked Korea captain Park Ji-sung who, in his 100th international, was chasing a long ball into the area which he did not look like getting. Ki Sung-yueng tucked the spot kick past Japan keeper Eiji Kawashima.Japan did not let the decision affect them and they were level after another superb attacking move down the left.Playmaker Keisuke Honda cut out three Korean defenders with a perfectly weighted through ball for Nagatomo and the fullback squared a cross which Ryoichi Maeda lifted over Jung for his third goal of the tournament.The chances began to dry up in the second half with nerves likely having an effect on the two young sides as the tempo slowed with both teams switching to a more defensive style.Lee Yong-rae came closest to scoring a second for the twice champion Koreans but his clipped free-kick from 22 metres sailed agonisingly wide of the post before the end of normal time.Extra time looked to have provided a winner when Japanese substitute Hajime Hosogai powered home the rebound after Jung had saved Honda's poorly struck penalty in the 97th minute.Saudi Arabian referee Khalil Al Ghamdi had initially pointed for a free-kick before awarding Japan a penalty after Korea defender Hwang was judged to have obstructed forward Okazaki.(Agencies)
