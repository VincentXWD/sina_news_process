"It has been only two days since Sydney. I didn't have much time to recover for the body.""Also, she's not playing bad. We had a lot of running on the court in the second set, and it became not easy to win a point." She added.After the 55-minute clash, Li said she was glad to have one-day rest."I can have good massage today and we will see how is the body feeling on Wednesday," she said.
