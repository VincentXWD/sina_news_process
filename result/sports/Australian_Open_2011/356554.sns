MELBOURNE  â€“ Britain's Andy Murray confirmed his brother Jamie killed a bird while practising for the Australian Open, mirroring a freak incident at the tournament nine years ago.The world number five said Jamie Murray, who is playing in the doubles, hit the bird while serving, in news that was broken to him by his mother."I haven't spoken to him about it. My mum told me about it when I woke up this morning. But I haven't seen him yet today," Murray told reporters.News of the death swept microblogging site Twitter, where Jamie Murray expressed regret over the incident but was pleased his serve was "accurate"."Yes I killed a bird with my serve, yes I was shocked... yes I hope it never happens again... but I hope my serve keeps being so accurate," Jamie Murray tweeted.Unfortunately it is not the first bird strike at the Australian Open. In 2002, Michael Llodra's powerful forehand downed a small bird during the men's doubles semi-final."That doesn't happen that often," said Andy Murray.(Agencies)
