Roddick overcomes crocked Haase at Aussie Open

MELBOURNEâ€“ Andy Roddick said a pivotal tiebreak win was the catalyst for swinging around losing momentum in his match with hobbling Dutchman Robin Haase to reach the Australian Open's fourth round.The American eighth seed looked flustered early on but put his game together to bundle out the 62nd-ranked Haase, 2-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2, 6-2 in 2hr 26min on the hottest day of the tournament.Roddick, a four-time semi-finalist at Melbourne Park, will play either Swiss 19th seed Stanislas Wawrinka or French 12th seed Gael Monfils in Sunday's round of 16.The big-serving Roddick, who relied heavily on his 32 aces, said he swung the match when he levelled by winning the second set tiebreak."Yeah, it was very important. It was pretty apparent I needed that to turn it," Roddick said."He kind of blinked for a second there for the first time of the day, and I was able to kind of turn it the way I wanted it to go."The biggest thing was that (tie) breaker. He wins that, I think that was the match."The giant Haase blazed away in the first couple of sets before the heat took its toll along with an injury to his ankle, which he rolled painfully early on."I think more often than not, if a guy is 65 or something in the world and is coming out of his shoes (playing well), you're trying to figure out during the course of the match why he's 65 in the world," Roddick said."But I was trying. I turned it. I started coming in a lot more. I stayed the course and figured it out."Haase got off to a wretched start when he rolled his right ankle in the second game and needed a medical timeout to strap it up and continue on in pain.But Haase had Roddick under pressure throughout the opening set, winning it with two service breaks, with the American failing to earn a break point.Roddick turned the match around when he capitalised on Haase's errors in the tiebreaker to level the match, and then hit the front with two more service breaks in the third set as Haase bravely battled on."He gave me some help in the tiebreaker by serving two double-faults and I hit a good return on the line and then had two serves with the wind behind me," Roddick said.It was plain sailing from there for Roddick with the big Dutchman tiring in the 32 deg C (90 F) heat and the effects of his ankle injury, and he was broken twice in the final set.Roddick's serve was on song and apart from his fusillade of aces had a first serve percentage of 68 percent.The American was an Australian Open semi-finalist in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 and last year was knocked out by Croatia's Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals.(Agencies)
