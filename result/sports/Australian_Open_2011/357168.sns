MELBOURNE â€“ Second seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva overcame a slow start to ease past Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-1 and move into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Monday.Zvonareva was broken early in the first set and was down 2-4 before she recovered to win the next four games and take a close opening set.There were no such problems in the second as the world number two ran away with the match to wrap up a comfortable victory in only 76 minutes."I was happy at the way I was able to come back when I was 4-2 down in the first set," she said.Zvonareva, 26, now meets another Czech player, Petra Kvitova, in the final eight following Kvitova's 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Italian Flavia Pennetta."She's had a great run here and beaten Sam Stosur and now Flavia so I know how tough that match is going to be," Zvonareva said.Zvonareva is looking to win her first Grand Slam title after finishing runner-up at Wimbledon and the US Open last year.The Russian, who has a chance to go to number one after the Open if results go her way, said she was improving every time she took to the Melbourne Park courts."I had a little bit of a slow start to the tournament but I have picked it up in every match," she said. "That's how you want it to be at a Grand Slam." Zvonareva's win has ensured there has now been a Russian quarter-finalist at the Australian Open every year since 2003.(Agencies)
