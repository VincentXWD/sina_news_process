MELBOURNE, Australia, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska saved two match points to win a thrilling three-set clash against China's Peng Shuai here on Monday, securing a top eight spot in the women's singles at the Australian Open.The 12th seed managed to go through the fourth round in Melbourne by 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 in two hours and 45 minutes, equaling her best performance at a Grand Slam.Refering to the two match points she had saved, the 21-year-old talent said she was just happy to make good shots on those key points, but it was weird that she wasn't nervous at all."I was just feeling so good on those match points," said Radwanska, "I don't know why, because normally my head is shaking and everything is under pressure. But I think it's because I just felt already like no pressure."It was the first tournament since her first round loss at China Open in October, 2010, following which she underwent a surgery for a right foot stress fracture."I think this is unbelievable. I really feel great. You know, not even till the last minute did I know I was going to play here. I was just very happy after the first match that I was playing match without any pain. Even if I lose the first round, I will be anyway happy that I didn't miss the Grand Slam and I'm back on tour." She commented on the comeback, adding she has nothing to lose in a possible quarterfinal clash with world No. 3 Kim Clijsters.Peng, coming to Melbourne as the 54th in the world, has already recorded her personal best by reaching the fourth round at a major.However, she was sad about failing to move one more step ahead with two matches points in hands while serving for match."I think at that time I felt really a bit tight, and also maybe a little bit unlucky," she said. "But for sure, she's a really good player. I already tried my best."Peng, who suffered eight three-sets out of 12 matches by now in the new season, added she was exhausted pending the end of the match."I think I really need to prepare for a longer stay in a tournament," she said. "I need a stronger body."
