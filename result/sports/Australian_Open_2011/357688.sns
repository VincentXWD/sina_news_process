Injured Nadal loses in quarterfinals(2)

But Murray held firm in the end and thinks it will help him in the semifinals. Murray lost the final here in straight sets last year to Roger Federer. He's a more experienced and accomplished player this year. And there's no certainty Federer will be in his path, anyway. The defending champion plays his semifinal Thursday night against Novak Djokovic, who beat him in the semifinals here in 2008 en route to the title. No. 3-ranked Djokovic also beat Federer in the semifinals of the last U.S. Open, after saving two match points. Nadal went on to win the U.S. Open and complete a career Grand Slam in all four majors. Between them, Nadal and Federer had combined to win 21 of the last 23 majors. Now, Federer is alone in the draw. Kim Clijsters has won the U.S. Open three times, including the last two since she returned in 2009 from more than two years in retirement to get married and have a child. On Thursday, she meets No. 2 Vera Zvonareva in a rematch of the U.S. Open final. Zvonareva has reached the last two Grand Slam finals, but has yet to win a major. Clijsters is aiming for her first major outside of U.S. soil — she reached the 2004 final here, only to lose to fellow Belgian Justine Henin. In the other women's semifinal, top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki will play China's Li Na, who is back at this stage for the second consecutive year. Li leads their head-to-heads 2-1, but hasn't gone further than the Grand Slam semifinals. Wozniacki ensured she'll hold onto the No. 1 ranking by reaching the semifinals, but would like to remove any doubt she deserves the top spot by winning her first major. Ferrer has never won a major, nor has Murray. When they meet Friday, Ferrer will be playing his second semi at a major; Murray his fifth. "I am playing a lot of years to the Grand Slams," said Ferrer, who won the Australian Open tuneup tournament in Auckland. "Of course, he has more experience than me. But now in this moment, I am 28 years. I am playing a lot of matches. I want to enjoy this moment, no? "The next match against Andy, it's another match in my career. Just I need to will fight a lot, like every match of my life." Fifth-ranked Murray was the only man to beat Nadal in a major last year. He would like to end a British drought at men's Grand Slams that dates to 1936. He had some challenges overcoming his 22-year-old Ukrainian rival Dolgopolov. Dolgopolov mixed up his slice and spin with deep flat shots, sometimes at the net, sometimes at the baseline, and rarely gave Murray a look at the same ball twice in a row. Although he had 77 unforced errors, it showed he was pushing the limits and constantly had Murray on guard. At the same point last year, Murray had just pulled off one of his biggest ever wins. Nadal was out of the tournament, and stayed off the tour until March while his right knee healed. There was some criticism of Nadal for retiring while trailing in the last set. Nadal didn't want to blame injuries this time. "It is obvious I did not feel at my best. I had a problem with the match at the very beginning, and after that, the match was almost over. In general, I had a virus. When you have a virus, your body goes down and you have more risk of everything," he said of a sickness he picked up in Doha at the start of the year and carried into the tournament. "That's probably what happened. That's the simple thing." Nadal was already looking forward to another successful year, saying he was more confident 12 months later. "Is different because last year was the knees. I had a problem, big problem, in the knee in the past," he said. "So was hard for me to have another time the same. I didn't see a solution in that. Is not the case. "This year everything is a little bit different. I have three more Grand Slams ... This year we start with a little bit of unlucky. I gonna work hard to come back and to keep having chances and to compete against the best players and to keep being in the top positions of the ranking."(Agencies)[Previous]　[1]　[2]
