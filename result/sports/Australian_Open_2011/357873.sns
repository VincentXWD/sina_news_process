MELBOURNE, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Roger Federer on Thursday crashed out of Australian Open in semifinal.World No. 2 Federer, who is playing his 8th consecutive Australian Open semifinal, was defeated by No. 3 Serbian Novak Djokovic 7-6 7-5 6-4 in three hours and one minute. Djokovic also beat Federer at the same stage of the U.S. Open last year.After the Serbian claimed a tight first set on a tie-break, Federer appeared to have turned the match around when he opened a 5-2 lead in the second.But the Swiss, a 16-time grand slam winner, then suffered complete meltdown, losing five games in a row to hand Djokovic a two-set lead.And Djokovic came through a topsy-turvy third set, breaking for 5-4 and serving out victory on his third match point.Djokovic has now ended Federer's bid to become the second man in history to win five Australian Open title. The last man to do so was Roy Emerson, who won the 5th Australian title in 1966 and the 6th Australian title in 1967.Djokovic, the only male Serbian Grand Slam champion, and also the only Serbian man to appear in a Grand Slam final, will next meet either 5th seed British Andy Murray or 7th seed Spanish David Ferrer in final.
