KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing 2022 made the final presentation hours before the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide on the hosting right of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, inviting the world sports governing body to take one step further to write a new history."On behalf of our people, we ask that you take this step with China and honor us with your vote, a vote that will impact generations," said Yu Zaiqing, Vice President of IOC and also Vice President of COC (Chinese Olympic Committtee).Beijing started the presentation at 11:55 am local time with a video message by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who introduced Chinese people's passion for Winter Games."The 2022 Olympic Winter Games if held in China will boost exchanges and mutual understanding between the Chinese and other civilizations of the world, encourage more than 1.3 billion Chinese to engage in winter sports with interest and passion and give them yet another opportunity to help advance the Olympic Movement and promote the Olympic Spirit," said president Xi.Yu explained in detail what the step meant to IOC and China."You have the choice to step forward with a partner who will not only deliver athlete-centered Games, but who will also build a foundation for ice and snow sports long into the future."You have the choice to step forward with a city that not only delivers a sustainable Games aligned with Agenda 2020, but that also influences a large nation and contributes to the creation of a better world."You have the choice to step forward with a country that not only delivers economical Games at the highest level, but that also considers legacy and delivery in equal measure, so the impact of hosting lasts many generations."Wang Anshun, President of Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games Bid Committee and Mayor of Beijing, spoke about the overall concept of the bidding."Our successful experience in hosting Games gives us even more confidence that we can achieve this," said Wang.Another video that introduced winter sports in China featured Yao Ming, former NBA All-Star playing as an ice hockey goalie, who was beaten by a kid."Basketball season in most of the world takes place during winter," said Yao, "so you might consider that it IS a winter sport."As Beijing is seeking to become the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics, the legacies from the 2008 Games, including the showpiece venues "Bird's Nest" and the "Water Cube" as well as the Games operation experiences, will help the Chinese capital honor its promise once again."In the 2008 Games, I played with the Chinese national team at the Wukesong Arena," Yao added."In Beijing 2022's plan, Wukesong will host ice hockey. I look forward to seeing a new chapter in the legacy of the Olympic Games as Wukesong is covered in ice."Eighty-five members of the IOC will vote for the 2022 Winter Olympics host on Friday afternoon. Candidate city collecting at least 43 votes will win the host right of the 2022 Games.
