MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Football fans all over Spain celebrated their country's 4-0 win over Italy in the final of the European Championship this Sunday night.Goals from David Silva, Jordi Alba, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata gave Spain the win against the Italians in Kiev: a victory which means the country becomes the first side ever to win two European Championships with the World Cup in the middle.Spain were crowned European Champions in Austria in 2008 and followed that up with the World Cup in South Africa two years ago.Tens of thousands of fans had gathered in the fan zone outside of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid to watch the game on giant TV screens, while there were other giant screens in Seville and Valencia.The semifinal win over Portugal on Wednesday had been the most watched program ever on Spanish TV and it was no surprise that most fans watched the games at home or in bars. When the final whistle went, it was the sign for celebrations all over the country - something Spanish fans have become used to, with thousands of fans showing their joy in the streets and also from their cars until the early hours of the morning.The Spain squad will return home on Monday and will celebrate their title with the fans in the Plaza Cibeles in Madrid, something that has caused controversy in Spain as that is where Real Madrid also celebrate their titles.Many fans believe it is wrong for the national team to go to a place so closely associated with one particular club.
