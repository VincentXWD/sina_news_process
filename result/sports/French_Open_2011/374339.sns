PARIS â€“ It's been eight years since the last time Roger Federer wasn't seeded No. 1 or 2 at a Grand Slam tournament.It's also been that long since he went 12 months without winning a major title.With the French Open starting Sunday, Novak Djokovic's winning streak and Rafael Nadal's pursuit of a sixth title at Roland Garros dominate the conversation.That means the third-seeded Federer is out of the spotlight. And he's fine with that.Federer says people "expect more from Rafa and Novak, and that could be a good thing for me." And, he adds, it could mean "more pressure for them."Federer owns a record 16 major singles championships, including the 2009 French Open. But he lost in the quarterfinals or semifinals at each of the last four majors.(Agencies)
