However, it was still a highly successful championship for him as he won two gold medals - the 200 metres, with a time of 19.40 secs, and the 4 x 100 metres relay, in which the Jamaican team set a new world record of 37.04 secs. Bolt finished the season in style, winning the Diamond League 100 metres in Brussels in September in 9.76 secs, the fastest time of the year.
