Sport: CyclingNominee 2012 - Laureus World Sportsman of the YearWon the 2011 Tour de France after dramatically taking the lead in the time trial on the penultimate day of the race. He was the first Australian to win the Tour and, at 34, the oldest winner in the post-war era. He showed great tactical awareness, believing if he kept near enough the lead he could take the yellow jersey in the individual time trial of Stage 20, which is exactly what happened. He also won the Tirreno-Adriatico and Tour de Romandie. In his early career, Evans was a champion mountain biker who turned to road racing after the Sydney Olympics. He was also second in the Tour de France in 2007 and 2008.Â
