Sport: Alpine SkiingNominee 2012 - Laureus World Sportswoman of the YearMaria Höfl-Riesch won the overall Alpine World Cup skiing title for the first time in 2011. Höfl-Riesch and American Lindsey Vonn, who had won the World Cup for the previous three years, had battled all season for supremacy. First Höfl-Riesch was ahead, then Vonn closed the gap. Going into the last race at Lenzerheide, Höfl-Riesch had a three point lead, which proved enough as bad weather forced cancellation leaving her as the champion. During the year, Höfl-Riesch won seven times – two Downhills at Lake Louise and another at Cortina, a Slalolm at Flachau, a Super Combined and a Super G at Are and the Nations Team Event at Lenzerheide.
