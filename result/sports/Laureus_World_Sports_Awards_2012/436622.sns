It could easily have been the gold medal. Dayron Robles was disqualified after encroaching on Liu’s lane and disrupting him over the final hurdle. Liu was promoted to silver, but Jason Robinson of the United States took the gold. Liu Xiang became an icon of Chinese sport after winning the 110m hurdles gold medal in Athens in 2004, but he managed just three steps in his opening heat in Beijing before pulling up with a hamstring injury. Now he will be focused on the London Olympics next year.
