In the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships the eight singles players are divided into two teams of four. From Tuesday through Friday the two groups play in a round robin format, meaning each player meets one another in their group. The two best-performed players of each group go on to the final phase that takes place during the weekend. In the semi-finals the first-placed woman from one group meets with the second-placed woman from the other, with the winners advancing to the final. All the matches are played to best-of-three-sets.The four-team doubles event is a straight knockout affair, with the winning team essentially needing to score semifinal and final victories.(Source:www.wtachampionships.com)
