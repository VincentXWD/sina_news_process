No pressure, only happiness for athletes

Even the athletes say they're not feeling much pressure as the Universiade approaches. Making his international debut, decathlete Sun Gang said he feels more relaxed than he would in a domestic competition, saying there's "no pressure for results". Sun, a sophomore from Beijing Sport University, admitted his performance might be hampered competing in the National Games with targets on his back. "But coming here, I don't need to set any goals. Nobody talks too much about the results, but (focuses instead on) cheering and having fun together. Feeling no pressure might help me do better than usual," said Sun, who majors in athletics training. Sun's teammate, Jin Qichao, who just finished his freshman year at Zhejiang University, echoed that sentiment. "We are in the summer holiday - coming here to race is just like traveling. We will just enjoy the sports fans, make some foreign friends and nothing else," said Jin. Jin studies business management in case he changes his mind and decides to "quit the game and pick up the family business one day". Joining Sun and Jin on Wednesday, dozens of students visited the new Qiaodan Sports Team China reception center beside the Universiade's main stadium. The center will provide facilities and services for mini press conferences or interviews with athletes every day. Qiaodan Sports will also donate 30,000 yuan ($4,638) to the China Youth Development Foundation for each gold medalist during the meet.
