SHENZHEN, China, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean gymnast Jo Hyunjoo caused a scare in the women's artistic gymnastics individual all-around final of the World University Games on Monday, which was eventually won by China's Xiao Kangjun.Jo, who qualified for the final in first place, landed on her back after she fell off the uneven bars during the second rotation. Jo was stretchered off by a medical team for evaluation.Before the end of the competition, a spokesman for the South Korean team said Jo's condition was not serious.A spokesperson for the Universiade said that Jo just suffered a soft tissue injury to her neck, instead of a cervical vertebra fracture which was originally feared.Xiao made her only noticeable error - a wobble as she landed a full-twisting jump on the balance beam - in the third rotation. However, the rest of Xiao's performances were elegant and precise, and she ended with a purposeful floor exercise routine that featured well-landed tumbling elements and dramatic choreography.With a winning total of 56.700 points, Xiao earned China a fourth successive Universiade individual all-around title in women's artistic gymnastics.Japan's Mai Yamagishi, who was in sixth place after vault in the first rotation, pulled into medal contention with her acrobatics-filled performance on balance beam in the third rotation.Yamagishi's nimble floor exercise routine in the fourth rotation clinched her the silver medal (56.100 points), which was Japan's first Universiade all-around medal in women's artistic gymnastics since 1997.Alena Polyan of Russia glided up the standings to eventully claim the bronze medal with 55.350 points. Needing a steady performance on floor exercise in the final rotation to secure a medal, Polyan replaced the layout double somersault on which she fell in Saturday's team competition with a clean triple twisting somersault that she landed well.
