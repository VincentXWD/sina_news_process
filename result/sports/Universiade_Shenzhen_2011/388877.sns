SHENZHEN, China, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Gong Jinjie claimed gold with a thrilling ride in a women's 500m trial final that saw the Universiade record smashed three times on Tuesday.Gong raced home in 34.910 seconds, an average speed of 51.561km per hour, to beat the mark of 34.985 seconds that silver medalist Lyubov Shulika of Ukraine had set moments before. Bronze went to Victoria Baranova of Russia.Guo Shuang of China, who raised the crowd's hopes when she became the first rider to beat the old record, had to settle for fourth, covering the course just .003 seconds faster Virginie Cueff of France.The serial record-setting was even more impressive given the stifling conditions on what is regarded as a relatively slow track.
