SHENZHEN, China, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- From Michael Johnson to Liu Xiang, many super stars started their career from the Universiade. The Shenzhen Universiade also saw a number of rising stars who would probably shine at 2012 London Olympics.1. Lee Dae Myung, South Korea, ShootingThe 23-year-old Lee Dae Myung upset Olympic medalist Pang Wei by winning both the men's 50m pistol individual and the 10m air pistol individual. It's quite possible that Lee makes an excellent performance to grab the first gold at London Olympics.2. Irie Ryosuke, Japan, SwimmingClaiming three gold medals at the Universiade did not mean too much for the 21-year-old Irie Ryosuke. Dreaming of overpassing the legendary predecessor Kosuke Kitajima, Ryosuke should target at least one gold medal at the London Olympics.3. Lei Sheng, China, FencingThough Lei Sheng failed to clinch the men's foil title, it would never stop him from fighting for the Olympic gold. As the men's foil team competition comes back to London Olympics, Lei and his teammates, the medalists of world championships, will endeavor for the Olympic gold.4. Haga Ryunosuke, Japan, JudoHaga Ryunosuke, the gold medalist of the men's 100kg, is considered as a genius. Now his goal is to compete in the London Olympic Games.5. Tang Yi, China, SwimmingThe 18-year-old Tang Yi is called Flying Fish in China. She broke the Universiade record of the women's 100m freestyle and the women's 4x100 relay. It may be difficult for the girl individually to win medals at the London Olympics, but she might claim one in relay.6. Qin Qian, China, JudoThe 23-year-old Qin Qian won the first gold medal for China, which raises questions for the Chinese judo team that if she will replace Olympic champion Tong Wen to represent China in the women's over 78kg at London Olympics.7. Phillips, United States, SwimmingEveryone knows (Michael) Phelps, but not Phillips. The 21-year-old reminded the audiences of Phelps when he won three gold medals in the swimming pool. But if he wants to compete in London Olympics, he should try hard to stand out among his strong compatriots.
