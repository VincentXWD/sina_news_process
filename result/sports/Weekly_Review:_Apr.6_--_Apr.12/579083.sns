Bastian Schweinsteigers' winner over Frankfurt secured Bayern's 23rd  Bundesliga title on Saturday ahead of schedule as they hold an  unassailable 20-point lead with just six rounds left to play.The German record champions added another title to their collection  as Schweinsteiger scored the only goal of the match against Frankfurt to  seal the earliest Bundesliga title in history.From the beginning the Bavarians dictated the proceedings on the pitch against defensively minded Frankfurt.The visitors almost broke the deadlock but the inside of the right  post denied Xherdan Shaqiris' effort from the edge of the box in the  10th minute.The hosts needed 15 minutes to create their first chance but unmarked  Karim Matmour was unable to control a long ball by Marco Russ.With 26 minutes into the game Bayern had a golden chance to take the  lead as Russ brought down Thomas Mueller inside the box to cause a  penalty. Bayern's youngster David Alaba squandered the penalty as he  only rattled the ball to the outside of the right post.Nonetheless the Bavarians were able to overcome Frankfurt's  well-positioned bulwark when Schweinsteiger back heeled a low cross by  Philipp Lahm past goalkeeper Oka Nikolov at the 52nd minute.Bayern nearly doubled the lead in the 67th minute but Xherdan Shaqiri pulled just wide from 20 meters.Frankfurt almost restored parity out of the blue when unmarked Srdjan  Lakic forced goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to make a save from very close  range with 11 minutes left.However, the Bavarians overcame a frenetic closing period to wrap up  their 23rd Bundesliga title after two years of a title drought in the  league."I am very delighted. This is of course an emotional moment, after 23  years I again clinched a Bundesliga title," Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes  said, who will be replaced by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola at  the end of the season.Elsewhere, Dortmund overpowered dedicated relegation threatened  Augsburg 4-2 to consolidate their second position six points ahead of  Leverkusen.Third positioned Leverkusen dropped points as they were held to a 1-1 draw with 12th placed Wolfsburg.Fourth placed Schalke defeated struggling Bremen 2-0 to tighten their Champions League play-off spot.Monchengladbach gained a hard earned 1-0 win over bottom side Greuther Fuerth and Hamburg lost 1-0 to Freiburg.The following matches are scheduled for Sunday: Hannover encounter Stuttgart and Nuremberg host Mainz.
