Iraq has executed seven people convicted of terror-related offences, an official said on Monday, despite widespread calls for the country to declare a moratorium on its use of the death penalty.All of those executed were Iraqi men, and brought to 29 the number of times Iraq has carried out the death penalty so far this year, according to an AFP tally. Baghdad executed 129 people in 2012, among the highest such figures in the world."Seven people were executed yesterday," a senior justice ministry official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the men were executed after having been convicted on terror charges.Justice Minister Hassan al-Shammari insisted last month that Baghdad would continue to implement the death penalty in the face of widespread calls for it to issue a moratorium.Iraq's executions have sparked concern from the United Nations, as well as Britain, the European Union and rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.(Agencies)
