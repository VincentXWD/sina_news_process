A spectacular collection of photographs has set out to capture the enlightenment, and in some cases disappointment, found when people try to connect with nature.Photographer Lindsay D'Addato, who lives and works between New York and central Wyoming, said she wanted to investigate, through her pictures, the supernaturality of everyday life.The result is a visually stunning series called 'Mystery, Magic, Mother,' which depicts a number of different characters united in the search of a grand illusion - an escape to the wilderness.'I am interested is exploring the visual manifestation of enlightenment in the physical world,' said D'Addato, who graduated from Brooklyn's Pratt Institute in 2008.According to the photographer, her pictures show people, sometimes accompanied by animals, as they struggle to experience connections with the earth and to each other.She explains the images not only capture moments of clarity, but also the disappointment felt by those whose dreams of finding enlightenment or a sense of peace and tranquility in the wilderness are left unfulfilled.(Agencies)
