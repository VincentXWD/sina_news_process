Who knew that when she launched onto the scene in 2002 with hits like S8er Boi that a pint-sized punk rocker from Canada was in the music business to stay.But 11 years later, Avril Lavigne is still turning out records.The 28-year-old singer rocked a mint-green frock and heavy eye make-up on the set of her new music video, filmed in Los Angeles on Sunday.Her new song, aptly titled Here’s to Never Growing Up, had the songstress in a childlike dress that she layered over rhinestone-adorned fishnet stockings.She teamed the look with a pair of red pumps, which she later switched for some more comfortable black fuzzy boots.It looked as if Avril was playing dress up in her mother’s old prom dress and she had her long blonde hair out and matted.A crown sat on top of her head and pitch-black eyes stared out from between her part.Heavy eye makeup has always been a part of Avril’s ensemble, but she took it to the extreme for her shoot, almost resembling a racoon.The singer was cheerful despite her goth-like makeup, though.Her fiancé, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger, acted as moral support on set, beaming next to her on the backseat of a golf cart.The pair got engaged in August of 2012 and seem to be even more in love than ever.Chad watched his wife-to-be as she posed with her bandmates, who were wearing colourful suit jackets and back trousers.Aside from singing and wedding planning, Avril has also been working on her own fashion line, Abbey Dawn, since 2008.On top of that, the star has her very own charity, The Avril Foundation, supporting 'children & youth with disabilities & serious illnesses.'(Agencies)
