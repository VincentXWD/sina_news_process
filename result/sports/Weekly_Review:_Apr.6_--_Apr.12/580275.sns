"Ding Dong! The witch is dead", as sung by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz, on Tuesday raced to the top of the Amazon download chart in Britain, a day after the death of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.Another version sung by jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald placed at number 4 and also topped the iTunes UK vocal chart as record-buyers passed their judgement on the legacy of Thatcher, who died of a stroke on Monday aged 87.The records' success comes on the back of a Facebook campaign celebrating the death of the divisive leader.The Official Charts Company, which collates sales from all outlets, predicts that the "macabre sense of humour of British music fans" will give the 1939 record a top 40 placing in their weekly chart."The leading contender by Judy Garland is likely to move into the Official Singles Chart Top 40 in its own right by Sunday if it maintains its current momentum," it said.(Agencies)
