Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight major countries started a two-day meeting Wednesday in London to discuss a wide range of global concerns, including the growing provocations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran's nuclear ambition and cybersecurity.The G-8 ministers are expected to condemn DPRK's escalation of its bellicose rhetoric and urge it to abide by its international obligations to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters earlier in the day that British Foreign Secretary William Hague who hosts the G-8 parley said DPRK will be a major topic and it is necessary to issue a unified message for DPRK as the G-8.DPRK has often been criticized for its nuclear weapons program at past G-8 foreign ministerial talks but Pyongyang's bellicose behavior is getting worse, with it threatening a nuclear strike against the United States and its allies.Kishida hopes to see unity among the G-8 members in underscoring the importance of implementing additional U.N. sanctions against DPRK based on a Security Council resolution adopted in March in response to Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February.Among other issues, the foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States are expected to discuss how to promote democratic transition and economic reform in Myanmar and ways to ensure a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria.Hague also aims to take up such issues as international efforts to prevent sexual violence in conflicts in the G-8 meeting.The gathering will lay the groundwork for the G-8 summit meeting to be held in Northern Ireland in June. The foreign ministerial meeting will wrap up on Thursday afternoon and issue a chair's statement.(Agencies)
