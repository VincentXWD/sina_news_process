China's religion watchdog on Thursday urged investigation of alleged demolition of buildings in a noted ancient temple in the city of Xi'an.Media reports said some buildings in the Xingjiao temple, which was constructed more than 1,300 years ago during the Tang Dynasty, were to be demolished.The temple is the burial place of many eminent monks, including Xuanzang.The State Administration for Religious Affairs has urged religious authorities in Xi'an to investigate the case as reported by the media and consult local Buddhists before properly acting in line with relevant laws and policies.The local government said the demolition was intended to clean up some unmatched buildings in the temple so that the site could have a better chance of applying for UNESCO World Heritage status.Many people, including some monks in the temple, have vocally opposed the demolition, according to media reports.
