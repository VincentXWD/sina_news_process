Chinese 14-year-old schoolboy Guan Tianlang fired a one-over par 73 in a historic Masters debut on Thursday, making himself the low amateur player in the field at Augusta National.Guan became the youngest player in Masters history when he teed off, breaking the previous age mark for the youngest Masters player set by Italy's Matteo Manassero at age 16 in 2010.But once the moment had passed, Guan then showed he had the skill to cope with the pressure of the moment in his first major tournament and the difficult Augusta National course that devoured many of his rivals.Guan opened with a bogey but responded with a birdie at the par-4 third hole. Bogeys at the par-4 seventh and ninth dropped him back, but Guan held his composure, going birdie-bogey to begin the back nine and again at 13 and 14.At the 18th hole, Guan hit a hybrid club approach to 20 feet and sank the pressure-packed putt to finish his round to the applause and cheers of the spectators around the final green.(Agencies)
