A court hearing involving a mother of a young rape victim who is suing a local authority for putting her into a labor camp began on Friday morning in Yongzhou City in central China's Hunan Province.Tang Hui, who has petitioned for harsher punishments for those guilty of raping her daughter and forcing her into prostitution, is demanding 1,463.85 yuan (234 U.S. dollars) in compensation from the city's re-education-through-labor commission for infringing her personal freedom, according to the Yongzhou Intermediate People's Court.In an administrative lawsuit in January, Tang had also demanded 1,000 yuan for psychological damage as well as a written apology.In January, the Yongzhou re-education-through-labor commission rejected her demand for state compensation for her detention in a labor camp.She has now taken her case to court.In October 2006, Tang's then 11-year-old daughter was kidnapped, raped and forced into prostitution. She was rescued on Dec. 30, 2006.On June 5 last year, the Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court sentenced two of the girl's kidnappers to death. Four others were given life sentences and another one received a 15-year term.Before and after the sentences were handed down, Tang had repeatedly petitioned in front of government buildings, complaining that the local police had falsified evidence to reduce the sentences of those involved.Police took Tang to a labor camp on Aug. 2, 2012 to serve an 18-month term for "seriously disturbing social order and exerting a negative impact on society" through her protests.Her detention led to public anger. Under public pressure, Tang was released eight days later, as the center said her daughter, who turned 17 last year, was still a minor in need of her mother's care.
