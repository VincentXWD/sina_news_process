We knew there was a high percentage of this to happen and that he would not play again. It was not a surprise for me," Scola said.Scola told TV sports channel ESPN that he had a good relationship with Yao, because he made Scola "things easier so I enjoyed playing with him."Yao joined the NBA in 2002 and had an average of 19 points and 9.2 rebounds per match.
