SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- When Yao Ming joined the NBA, he would never have imagined that he could someday be mentioned in the same breath as Mencius, by an American president.In a 2009 Washington meeting, President Barack Obama quoted Yao Ming and ancient Chinese philosopher Mencius at the same speech."Of course as a new president and also as a basketball fan, I have learned from the words of Yao Ming who said, 'No matter whether you are new, or an old team member, you need time to adjust to one another,'" Obama said."Through the constructive meetings that we have already had, and through this dialogue, I am confident that we will meet Yao's standard."The 2.26-meter Shanghai native, who announced his retirement on Wednesday, has impressed the world with a formidable set of basketball skills, an engaging personality and the commitment to social responsibility."We are going to miss you, bro. You're one of the greatest players to ever come out of China," said Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal in an online video post.INJURY-PLAGUED CAREERYao, who will turn 31 this September, is God's gift to Chinese basketball. Apart from his overwhelming dominance and physical presence, Yao possesses many talents most giant centers do not have.His mobility and dazzling footwork often earn him easy points, while his fade-away shot, hook shot and good shooting touch are the sharp weapons around the low-post. And his brilliant passing often provides open shot chances to his teammates off the three-point line.However, his nine years in the NBA were never plain sailing. The Rockets' top pick in the 2002 draft, who experienced a scoreless maiden NBA show, tried his best to find chemistry with the team and managed to prove his worth in his rookie season, in which Yao averaged 13.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.74 blocks in 82 games and was selected to the All-Rookie, All-Star team."Keep working hard", the words Yao typed on his laptop screen saver, are his motto. Throughout his first three seasons in NBA, Yao never took it easy in training and he had only missed two matches.However, starting from 2005, Yao had five major surgeries to his left foot, missing 250 NBA games. The fragile left foot finally forced Yao to retire early.Even though the Houston Rockets has never managed to measure up to the high expectation, Yao, who averaged 19.0 points and 9.2 rebounds in his NBA career, received numerous honors, including being voted as the All-Star starter in eight of his nine seasons.During a promotional tour in China this month, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant said Yao deserved a place in the Basketball Hall of Fame."He does so much for the game, and he does deserve to be in the Hall of Fame," said Durant. "He's so dominant in the game, and he changed the game by his just running up and down the floor."MORE THAN A PLAYERIn the 1990s, a consummate player wearing 23 helped NBA become more of an art than a game, while in the new century, the Chinese big guy wearing 11 single-handedly raised the NBA profile among one fifth of mankind.Although his success on the court can not be compared with that of legendary Michael Jordan, Yao's achievements off the court helped to promote cooperation and exchange between the Chinese and American basketball cultures.　[1]　[2]　[3]　[Next]
