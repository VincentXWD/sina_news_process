MONTEVIDEO, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Radamel Falcao insists Colombia's confidence has not been dented by a 2-0 loss to Uruguay as the team attempts to qualify for its first World Cup since 1998.Jose Pekerman's side looked set for the point it needed to earn a berth in Brazil next year before late goals from Edison Cavani and Christian Stuani gave the hosts a 2-0 victory at the Estadio Centenario.Colombia's remaining two South America zone qualifiers are at home to Chile and away to Paraguay."We are still second (in the standings) and now we will play at home and we will continue to fight," Falcao said."We are very close. We are not going to fold our arms. We will leave this result here. Now we have the possibility of qualifying in Barranquilla."The top four South American teams automatically qualify for the World Cup while fifth will play off against the fifth-ranked side from Asia."We are going to keep a positive frame of mind," Falcao said. "We know there are areas where we have to improve."We are only thinking about the match against Chile. We have a lot of motivation and determination because we are very close to going to Brazil."
