LAGOS, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Super Eagles will qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup when they meet the Walya Antelopes of Ethiopia in the final playoff for the 2014 World Cup, former defender Taribo West said on Wednesday.The former player told reporters in Lagos that the Super Eagles had an edge considering the sustained progress in the team's rebuilding process.The Super Eagles only need to be careful during the match, he added, noting that It's not going to be a walkover, but that the country will qualify."The Ethiopia team I saw at the Nations Cup looked like young boys that are hungry for football," West said.According to him, the Antelopes of Ethiopia are building up very strongly but the Eagles will qualify."We have a lot of experience on our side," the former AC Milan player added.The Nigerian team will lock horns with the Walya Antelopes of Ethiopia in the final playoffs for the 2014 World Cup.The first leg of the match will hold in Ethiopia on Oct. 11, while the second leg will be played in Nigeria on Nov.15, at a yet-to-be-determined venue.
