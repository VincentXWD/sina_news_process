QUITO, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's President Rafael Correa Monday said he was confident the national team will succeed in qualifying automatically for the 2014 Brazil World Cup, when it plays Chile Tuesday in the final day of the South American Qualifying Tournament."Tomorrow last try in Chile," Correa said via Twitter. "It's almost impossible to be left out" of football's top competition.Using the team's nickname, Correa said he was "still happy about the Tri's victory" last Friday, when it defeated Uruguay 1- 0, putting the team just one point shy of qualifying automatically for Brazil.By beating Uruguay, Ecuador held on to fourth place in the regional tournament, behind Argentina, Colombia and Chile. The top four teams advance directly to the World Cup, while the fifth must go to playoffs.Ecuador heads into its away match against Chile, in Santiago, with 25 points and a goal tally of +5.Meanwhile, Chile remains in third place after its 3-3 tie with Colombia, in a match played in Colombia's northern city of Barranquilla.The Ecuadorian team, which arrived in Chile Saturday, will not include forward Joao Rojas, who plays for Mexico's Cruz Azul, due to a muscular contraction suffered in the game against Uruguay.On Sunday, Ecuador trained in Santiago as it waited for Colombian coach Reinaldo Rueda to confirm the definitive lineup that will face off against Chile Tuesday.
