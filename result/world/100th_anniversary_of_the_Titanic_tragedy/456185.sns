LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- "The Hunger Games" easily fends off a pair of new films, 3-D re-release of "Titanic" and Universal's comedy "American Reunion" to remain on top of the North America box office for three weekends in a row.The Lionsgate sci-fi actioner is estimated to gross 33.5 million U.S. dollars over the weekend, a 43 percent slide from last weekend, but good enough to up its cumulative gross to 302.8 million dollars. As industry observers put it, excellent word-of- mouth and an outburst of Easter holiday audiences helped the PG-13 Suzanne Collins' adaptation remain top-notch during the box office derby.The fourth movie in the box-office hit "American Pie" film series, "American Reunion" opened to 21.5 million dollars, well in line with Universal's pre-release estimates, but considerably fewer than the last installment, "American Wedding," opening with 33 million dollars.

Many of the weekend audiences were adults, with 61 percent of them was over the age of 25.The original comedy "American Pie" debuted in July 9, 1999, and became an instant worldwide pop culture phenomenon.
