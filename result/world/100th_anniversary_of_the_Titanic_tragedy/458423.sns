"Titanic" is one of the biggest blockbusters in history, and the 3D re-release of the film is a big hit in China, but one of the most iconic scenes has been altered by government censors.The scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jack, sketches a nude Rose - played by Kate Winslet - has been edited so that the actress' bare breasts are not shown.Fans will remember that Winslet's breasts are uncovered in the original. The film was first released in 1997 and became one of the highest-grossing movies ever.Chinese fans of the movie aren't happy about the censorship."I've been waiting almost 15 years, and not for the 3D icebergs," one disgruntled fan wrote in a widely forwarded microblog post, according to a report in China Daily.In a statement, China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television explained the reason for the censorship - and it wasn't due to an aversion to nakedness."Considering the vivid 3D effects, we fear that viewers may reach out their hands for a touch and thus interrupt other people's viewing. We've decided to cut off the nudity scenes," the agency said.
