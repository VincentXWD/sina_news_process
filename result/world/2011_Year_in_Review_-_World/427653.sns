A report published by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) showed the world's population reached 7 billion on Oct. 31, 2011. On one hand, the population growth is due to better living conditions backed by economic and science advances. But on the other, it puts huge pressure on natural resources and ecological environment.Problems concerning an aging society, food security, education, health care and employment will continue to test policymakers in the coming centuries. And controlling population growth reasonably will be on the agenda of nations seeking sustainable development.
