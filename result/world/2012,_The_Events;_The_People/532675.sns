Sina EnglishWith a majority vote, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on Thursday night, granting Palestine the status of an observer nation in the global organization.138 countries, including China, Russia and South Africa for the resolution and 19 states against it including Israel, the U.S., and Canada with the rest of the member countries abstaining.The adopted document reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the independence of the State of Palestine with its territory based on the 1967 borders.Recognition as a state will allow the Palestinian National Authority to apply to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, with lawsuits against the Israeli occupation of its lands.Members have also pointed to the need for an early resumption of the Middle East peace process.This provision was in response to the fears of the U.S. and Israel, who believe that the Palestinians have achieved self-determination unilaterally.Israel says UN vote a meaningless resolution A UN General Assembly vote on Thursday recognizing a Palestinian state will do nothing to make it a reality, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.Israel had fiercely opposed the Palestinian bid to become a "non-member state" at the United Nations, but had been unable to prevent wide international support for the initiative, notably among its European allies."This is a meaningless resolution that won't change anything on the ground. No Palestinian state will arise without an arrangement ensuring the security of Israeli citizens," Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office shortly before the UN vote was to be held.Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of violating agreements with Israel by going to the UN unilaterally. "Israel will act accordingly," Netanyahu said. "The way to peace between Jerusalem and Ramallah is through direct negotiations without preconditions, not unilateral decisions at the UN"The Israeli leader used unusually strong language to denounce a speech to the General Assembly by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who had singled out an Israeli offensive in Gaza last week in which at least 170 Palestinians were killed.Six Israelis died in rocket fire from Gaza. Abbas's comments were "hostile and poisonous", and full of "false propaganda", a statement released by Netanyahu's office said. "These are not the words of a man who wants peace."Israel had mounted an intensive campaign, supported by the United States, to dissuade European governments from backing the Palestinian move in the 193-nation UN General Assembly, long sympathetic to the Palestinians.US official calls UN recognition "political theater" The United Nations voted to grant Palestine nonmember observer status this afternoon, over the objections of American diplomats, a decision that drew an unequivoal reaction from New York's elected officials."Today's political theater at the United Nations is a harmful distraction from achieving true peace and stability between Israel and Palestine," said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in a statement shortly after the vote.The United States previously blocked a vote by the U.N. to recognize Palestinian statehood, but was unable to block the vote for nonmember status, which could accord Palestine access to new legal channels for challenging Israel in court.Gillibrand urged the U.N.'s secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, "to do everything in his power to block the Palestinians from access to the International Criminal Court.”Rep. Eliot Engel said the vote "places the cart before the horse and eliminates the incentives for the Palestinians to engage in any type of dialogue with Israel" and that the international community had its approach to Palestine "backwards."
