Mo Yan, dressed in black tailcoat, went slowly up to his seat on the stage with the other Nobel Prize winners.Marcus Storch, chairman of the Board of Nobel Foundation first addressed the ceremony and welcomed the winners for attending the ceremony in Sweden.King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf awarded Mo Yan the Nobel diploma, medal and a document confirming the prize amount after a representative of the Nobel Prize jury in literature introduced the achievement of Mo Yan in literature.After that the orchestra at the ceremony presented a part of the "Aladdin Suite" called "Chinese Dance" and the Concert Hall became full of Chinese elements.2012 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Medicine and Economics also went up to receive the award from the King.Nobel Prize this year in Physics went to Serge Haroche of France and David J. Wineland from the U.S. Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry were American scientists Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka. Nobel Prize in Physics was won by Shinya Yamanaka from Japan and John B. Gurdon from Britain. Nobel prize in Economics was shared by American economists Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley.The amount of each Nobel Prize this year was 800 million Swedish kronor (about 114 million U.S. dollars).About 1,500 people attended the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony this year, including members of the royal family of Sweden and Swedish politicians.Since 1901, the Nobel Prizes have been presented to the Laureates at ceremonies on 10 December which is the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.Mo Yan’s win brings Chinese modern literature to a visible height Sina EnglishFinally, the much-sought after Nobel Prize falls within the hand of a Chinese.China's modern culture is becoming as famous a brand as the Chinese economy. On December 10, Mo Yan has climbed the cultural Olympus by accepting the Nobel Prize winner's award in literature from the hands of the king of Sweden.Also, not a few observers both with and outside of China also believe the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Chinese citizen will raise the reputation of the modern Chinese literature as whole.Thanks to the mixing of literary genres, Mo Yan’s novels gain the traits of a brilliant phantasmagoria, in which one can easily decipher a sharp satire in folk customs of the modern Chinese society.Mo Yan gives the hard truth about his country and his people. He is a great storyteller. In his works that are so full of philosophical parables and catchy maxims one can easily see the traditions of the classical Chinese literature. And how full of love are his descriptions of his country and his admiration of the nature! He loves his country and therefore is seriously worried about it.Today, the Nobel committee does not seek out writers, who really create something grand in their national culture. Take for example the winners of the last decade – the Russians Brodsky and Sholokhov, Marquez from Colombia, Thomas Mann from Germany. The current winner from China might well be viewed as a postmodernist.
