BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- As Vladimir Putin was sworn in as Russia's new president and retook his office in the Kremlin on Monday, experts said his reascendancy to the country's top political post would further improve Russia-China relationship during his third presidential term."He's always a top decision-maker. And his return to the Kremlin will guarantee the continuity of Russia's domestic and foreign policy, which means a sound relationship with China," said Sheng Shiliang, a researcher of the Development Research Center of the State Council.President Hu Jintao has congratulated Putin several times after the publication of the primary voting results on March 5."The close contact between the two leaders showcases the close cooperation between the two states," said Xing Guangcheng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Since 2000, China and Russia have witnessed rapidly growing cooperation, including improved strategic communication, booming trade and frequent exchanges in humanitarian fields.Sino-Russian trade volume surged from 8 billion U.S. dollars in 2000 to 80 billion U.S. dollars in 2011, according to Chinese customs statistics."That happened during Putin's first two terms as president from 2000 to 2008, and his one term as prime minister," Sheng said, noting "remarkable progress" has been achieved in various sectors ranging from politics, economy to culture.However, compared with the previous decades, China and Russia are facing a world that is experiencing dramatic changes.China and Russia will attach more importance to bilateral relations in the light of the shift in global balance of power, said Sheng.Sheng said Putin's campaign article on foreign policy indicated that Russia will not be content with just being a regional power, but will try to regain its status as a world power.In order to achieve this goal, Russia's foreign policy will be more orientated toward the Asia-Pacific, especially toward China.In addition, China and Russia together agree to safeguarding world stability and development, in particular promoting equality in the world, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, multi-polarization, and the maintenance of the UN's authority, he noted.Both countries hope to embark on economic restructuring, and push forward the reform of global economic governance. This provides a great opportunity for economic and trade cooperation, said Xing.China and Russia have cooperated well in jointly coping with the negative impacts of the financial crisis, he said.8 The two nations have broad space for cooperation in developing innovative economy and high value-added industries, he said.During Vice Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Russia last month, China and Russia signed several cooperative agreements on improving high-technology cooperation.These agreements demonstrate the will of both sides to beef up cooperation in the non-energy area, he said.On regional economic cooperation, Xing said China has docked its Northeast Area Revitalization Plan with Russia's plan to develop Siberia and the Far East.The regional economic cooperation between China and Russia has an edge in labor costs, logistics and industrial chains, he said.As a realist, Putin did not dodge the problems and conflicts between the two countries in his article, such as unbalanced trade structure.Putin's candid attitude toward such problems is the result of solid mutual trust between the two countries, said Xing."As China and Russia have established a solid, in-depth and sustained relationship on the basis of mutual trust, they do not have to feel out each other during Putin's presidency in the next six years," he said.
