PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- French president-elect Francois Hollande Wednesday had his first "rendez-vous" with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy at his campaign headquarters in Paris.During the half-an-hour meeting, the newly elected French president and the European Union's leader focused their discussions mainly on economic issues.The two leaders "have exchanged their views on the European Union (EU) in all its dimensions, from the eurozone to the Greek crisis," said Pierre Moscovici, Hollande's spokesman during the transition period."Hollande has shown the need for a strategy, a growth agenda," the spokesman said at a press conference, noting that "the strategy of growth ... is made more necessary because of the crisis."Hollande's first formal meeting with the European officials came before an informal European summit in Brussels on May 23 announced by Van Rompuy on Tuesday, which will be gathering of heads of state and government to seek ways addressing the eurozone economic headaches.The Socialist candidate had pledged in his election campaign to renegotiate the European fiscal treaty signed by 25 leaders of EU member countries which aims to help debt-stricken eurozone nations reverse the morose economic situations.Hollande prefers to complement the fiscal treaty characterized by austerity with pro-growth approaches, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday reiterated that EU countries must stick to what they have agreed for the fiscal treaty. The German government had called for pro-growth measures to be added to the treaty, insisting that both budget cutting and growth initiatives are necessary to the economic recovery.Even European leaders do not share with Hollande on the political agenda, they "are showing a great availability to debate with Mr. Hollande on the growth agenda," Moscovici said.Moscovici also announced that the new president will on Thursday meet with President of the Eurogroup Jean-Claude Juncker.
