CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) chief Nabil al- Arabi said a suicide bombing ripped through the Syrian national intelligence headquarters in Damascus on Wednesday morning and it will influence the current situation in the country.In an AL statement, al-Arabi said the pan-Arab body has " repeatedly warned against violence which creates violence, widens the cycle of destruction, and threatens to make Syria slide into a civil war, and it will affect the whole region, not only Syria."He asserted AL's stance that the only safe solution for this crisis is an urgent response to the legitimate rights of the Syrians with a peaceful transition to a democratic system.The blast occurred at the time when Syrian ministers and intelligence chiefs were meeting in the targeted building, killing the country's Defense Minister Dawood Rajha and his deputy Asef Shawkat, who is also the brother-in-law of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
