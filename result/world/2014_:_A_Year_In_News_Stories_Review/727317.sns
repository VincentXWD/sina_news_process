Keith Boyd of the Marin County coroner's office said Williams was last seen by his wife, Susan Schneider, when she went to bed around 10:30 p.m. Sunday. She left their home around 10:30 a.m. Monday, believing her husband was still asleep in a different room."Mr. Williams' personal assistant became concerned at approximately 11:45 a.m. when he failed to respond to knocks on his bedroom door," Boyd said."At that time, the personal assistant was able to gain access to Mr. Williams' bedroom and entered the bedroom to find Mr. Williams clothed, in a seated position, unresponsive, with a belt secured around his neck, with the other end of the belt wedged between the closed closet door and the door frame," he added."His right shoulder area was touching the door with his body perpendicular to the door and slightly suspended," Boyd said. "Mr.Williams at that time was cold to the touch with rigor mortis present in his body.The inside of Mr. Williams' left wrist had several acute superficial transverse cuts. A pocketknife, with red material on its blade, was in close proximity to Mr. Williams.Boyd said the pocketknife was also examined, but it is unknown at this time if the dried red material is in fact blood or if it is Mr. Williams' blood.The coroner's office announced Monday that physical signs showed Mr. Williams died from asphyxia due to hanging, while further forensic examination was conducted Tuesday morning.Boyd said toxicology tests will be conducted to determine if Williams had any drugs or alcohol in his system, but those tests would take two to six weeks to complete.Williams' media representative, Mara Buxbaum, told media Monday that Williams, 63, had been battling severe depression.Williams' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was turned into a memorial after the news of his death was released on Monday.
