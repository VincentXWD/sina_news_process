Speculation has been rife since she pulled out of the U.S. Open and other hard-court tournaments because of knee injuries that flared up in July.Her husband Jiang Shan revealed on Friday that Li is currently receiving treatment on both her knees in Germany.As Li waved farewell to professional tennis, China lost another high profile figure that enjoyed international fame. Former NBA center Yao Ming put an end to his playing days in 2011.
