Hugely popular in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, she has also gained a large following in Japan, and was characterized by Jeroen de Kloet as “singer, actress, mother, celebrity, royalty, sex symbol and diva all at the same time.”Nicholas Tse is a Hong Kong singer, songwriter, musician, actor, and entrepreneur. Tse is a member of the Emperor Entertainment Group.Their love story has started as early as 2000 when the two were seen dating in a pub after Wong divorced her first husband Dou Wei. But Wong and Tse split in 2003.Wong later married actor Li Yapeng in 2005, while Tse wedded Cecilia Cheung(Zhang Bozhi) the next year. In 2011, Tse divorced Cheung not long after their second son was born, and Wong divorced again with her second husband last year.Many netizens condemn the two for their irresponsible conduct towards their families and children. “Maybe the two had undergone a difficult time during the 11 years, but they shouldn’t abandon their families and children. It is especially unfair for Cecilia Cheung, who has to pay the fiddler by taking care of the two sons on her own,” a netizen said.(Wang Ruiqi)
