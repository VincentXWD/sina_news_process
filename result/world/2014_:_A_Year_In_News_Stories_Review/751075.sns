Guangzhou Evergrande clinched their fourth Chinese Super League (CSL) title in as many years after a 1-1 draw on Sunday at Shandong Luneng in Ji'nan, East China's Shandong Province.Like the penultimate round a week ago, all eight games in the last round kicked off at the same time Sunday ­afternoon.Luneng were the better performers in the first half in Ji'nan. In the 12th minute, Li Wei's long pass found Liu Binbin on the counterattack. Liu's shot outside the penalty area went to the bottom right corner of the net when facing Evergrande keeper Zeng Cheng. Evergrande didn't play well enough but were lucky when Brazilian striker Elkeson's long shot outside the box went directly into the net shortly ­before halftime.This was Elkeson's 28th goal of the season, one which set a new CSL record, beating former top goal-scorer in a season, Chinese striker Li Junyu. Li scored 26 goals to help Luneng win the league title in 2006. Elkeson scored 24 last season, becoming the first ­player to score more than 20 goals in two consecutive years, and the first to score over 50 goals in two seasons.Both sides had several clear-cut chances in the second half, but failed to turn the chances into goals.Evergrande's head coach Marcello Lippi said the team's performance in the first half was "ugly," but they deserved the result with their second-half performance.After his speech on the title in the post-match news conference, Lippi made a statement that surprised all fans. "This might be my last game as the head coach of Evergrande," the Italian told reporters. "I won't be the head coach next season; I will be the chief technical ­director next year."He said it is a personal decision. "I will be 67 soon," Lippi said. "I am tired of leading players in training sessions every day, and giving commands on the bench during games."At the same time in Beijing, Guoan failed to score even one goal with 29 shots in total. With the heroics of goalkeeper Han Feng and the woodwork, Henan Jianye successfully held Guoan to a goalless draw to avoid relegation to the second tier next season. One of the shots from Guoan's Montenegrin striker Dejan Damjanovic hit the bar in the first half. Han made several brilliant saves and finally kept a clean sheet. In the end, Guoan had to settle for the runner-­up spot with 67 points, three ­after Evergrande.Guangzhou R&F finished third in the table, after their 3-1 win away over Jiangsu Saity. Luneng are fourth on 48 points.The top four teams will play in next season's Asian Champions League. ­Evergrande and Guoan have qualified for the group stage, while R&F and Luneng have to play qualifiers.Besides the R&F vs. Sainty game, only one game did not end in a draw on Sunday: Guizhou Renhe defeated ­Harbing Yiteng 3-2 at home. Guoan vs. Jianye was the only goalless game of the round.Fifteenth-placed Dalian Aerbin and bottom side Harbin Yiteng were relegated to the second-tier League One. Chongqing Lifan and Shijiazhuang Yongchang will replace them and play in the CSL next year.
