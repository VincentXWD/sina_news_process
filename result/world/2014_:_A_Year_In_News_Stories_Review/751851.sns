WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Republicans have picked up enough seats to gain majority in the U.S. Senate and maintained their control of the House of Representatives, according to U.S. media projections on Tuesday.Citing exit polls, Fox News and the CNN projected that Republicans, who currently hold 45 seats, have taken the Senate back from the Democrats eight years after losing the 100-member chamber by adding at least seven seats in the midterm elections.Up to early hours of Wednesday, Republican candidates picked up the seven key states previously held by Democrats in Iowa, Montana, Colorado, North Carolina, Arkansas, South Dakota and West Virginia to gain 52 seats in the Senate.The victory will give Republicans full control of Congress, as they fortified on Tuesday their dominance in the House of representatives. The outcome is expected to deal a major blow to President Barack Obama and cast shadows on his last two years in the White House.Three incumbent Democratic senators -- Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and Mark Udall of Colorado -- have lost the seats to their Republican challengers.Joni Ernst netted a crucial seat in Iowa for the GOP and Republican Shelley Moore Capito, Mike Rounds and Steve Daines won the races in West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana respectively.Louisiana's Senate race will head to a runoff in December as neither incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu nor Republican Bill Cassidy was able to gain more than 50 percent of the vote.Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Republicans, won a re-election in Kentucky on Tuesday and is poised to become the Majority Leader in the Republican Senate.According to projections, Republicans have maintained their House majority and won more seats than the previously held 233 in the 435-member chamber.Tuesday's midterm elections came at a time when Obama's support rate is dropping to a low point of about 44 percent. The outcome also revealed a sense of disillusionment among U.S. voters with both parties.An NBC News national exit poll found that nearly one in five voters have lost all trust in the federal government and a similar number are angry with both Obama and the Republican leaders in Congress.The poll also found 79 percent of voters disapprove of the job Congress is doing, near the all time high 80 percent disapproval recorded in 1994.A bipartisan group of House and Senate leaders will head to the White House on Friday to meet with Obama, Congressional aides and a White House official said late Tuesday.The meeting is expected to include McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
