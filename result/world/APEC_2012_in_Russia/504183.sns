By Li Hongmei, Special to Sina EnglishThe forthcoming APEC summit slated for Friday through to Sunday will bring together heads of states, presidents of major companies and top economists. In the next three days the host city of Vladivostok is set to become a political and economic hub of the Asia-Pacific region. While compiling the agenda of the summit, Russia staked on key economic issues, such as the liberalization of global economy, as Russian President Vladimir Putin said while accepting an exclusive interview with RT TV channel.One of the questions goes as follows:When you are there you’ll be meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. You won’t be meeting Barak Obama because he’s not there, Hilary Clinton will be. Is that a sign of how he regards APEC? We know he’s busy but is it a sign of how he regards it? And is it a sign that China is increasingly becoming a bigger geopolitical and commercial partner for you?Vladimir Putin replies in the way as follows:China is indeed becoming a global economic and political hub. This is part of a global trend, with new centers emerging on the political and economic landscape. This is an obvious fact for everyone; the question is the pace of change. China has taken up this new leading role not only in Russia’s eyes, but also in the eyes of the whole world.What makes us rather special, however, is that Russia and China are neighbors, and our special relations took thousands of years to evolve to where we are now. We have been through times of sunshine which were very beneficial for both countries. We have also been through periods of gloom and conflict. Presently, Russia-China relations are at an unprecedented high, and we share mutual trust both in politically and economically. Over the coming years we are bound to achieve a 100 bln dollar turnover rate. To put this in perspective, currently Europe makes up 51% of Russia’s foreign trade, which amounts to over 200 bln dollars. That will be a serious push forward.Our American partners told us long ago that Barack Obama will not attend the summit. The reason is the election race in the U.S., we think it’s okay. The U.S. will still be represented at a high level. So, yes, we’ve known that for several months now, and we fully understand the reasons. Anyway, this will be a great summit, with top officials coming from twenty countries - heads of states and governments. Of course, it’s a pity that the U.S. president cannot come this time, but nothing doing. I think if he really had the opportunity, he would not miss it, because it’s a good event for the U.S. to talk not only with us but also with other Asia-Pacific partners.Related news:Putin to meet Clinton on Syria at APEC sidelinesPutin reviews domestic policies, warns West on SyriaChinese president arrives in Vladivostok for APEC meetingSpecial Coverage:
