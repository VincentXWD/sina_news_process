Over 300 CEOs from the business circles from around the Pacific rim gathered on Friday in the Russian Far Eastern city of Vladivostok for their 2012 summit held parallel to the annual APEC leaders' summit.This year's CEO summit went underway with a discussion first on the benefits and unintended consequences of the economic integration as has been promoted by the 21-member economies of the APEC forum.A total of four discussion panels and many interactive panels have been scheduled for the Vladivostok CEO summit, which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao are expected to address.Initiated in 1996, the APEC CEO summit has provided opportunities for business leaders from around the region to engage in discussions and interact with APEC leaders and policy-makers on issues concerning their respective sectors and the region as a whole.The CEO summit is usually held just prior to the two-day APEC leaders' summit and overlap with the latter by one day.Chinese President Hu and U.S. President Barack Obama addressed last year's CEO summit held in Hawaii, but the U.S. president has skipped this year's summit citing reasons from the bi-party presidential campaign race back home.
