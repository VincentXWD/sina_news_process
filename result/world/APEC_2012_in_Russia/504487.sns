VLADIVOSTOK, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao and his Indonesian counterpart Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono met Saturday in Vladivostok, Russia, on bilateral cooperation and other issues of common concern.The two leaders were meeting on the sidelines of the annual Economic Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.Hu said that he is looking forward to having a thorough exchange of views with Yudhoyono on bilateral relations and issues of common concern on the occation of the APEC meeting.Yudhoyono said that bilateral relations between Indonesia and China have been advancing smoothly on the basis of the strategic partnership established seven years ago.China and Indonesia established a strategic partnership in April 2005 when Hu paid a state visit to the Southeast Asian nation.The strategic cooperation between China and Indonesia is increasingly reflected in the active cooperation between the two countries on major global and regional issues against the backdrop of the current complicated international situation.During his meeting with Yudhoyono in Jakarta last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said further strengthening China-Indonesia strategic cooperation not only conforms to the fundamental interests of both countries, but serves as a role model for the region.
