Nearly one year to the day since his plan to host a protest in front of Dearborn's Islamic Center of America was thwarted, anti-Islamic pastor and Florida politician Terry Jones said he is coming back.Jones, who is most famously known for his public burning of the Muslim holy book the Quran, announced on Feb. 1 that he will hold a demonstration on April 7 in front of Dearborn's largest mosque.Terry Jones supervised the burning of the Koran in 2011. As a result, the charred Koran inspired a deadly attack and violent protests across Afghanistan.Jones said he feels no responsibility for the violence sparked by his church's action, including the violent protest at a United Nations complex in Afghanistan that left at least 11 people dead - and 20 killed in weekend violence.After the Koran burning, the death threats kept streaming in.Jones and his assistant Wayne Sapp, the man who actually soaked the Koran in kerosene and burned it, said later in an interview that they're not afraid and are willing to die for their beliefs.
