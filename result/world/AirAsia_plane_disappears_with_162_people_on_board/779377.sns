Indonesian divers on Monday found another six victims of the AirAsia plane crash, an official said, taking to 84 the number of bodies retrieved since the accident in late December.Two bodies were found inside the fuselage of the plane, while another four were located near the wreckage on the bottom of the Java Sea.Another body was located on Sunday as the national search and rescue agency resumed operations. Divers had taken a two-day break after searching at sea for weeks in poor weather conditions.The mission is continuing to find the bodies of the remaining 78 people aboard Flight QZ8501, which went down in stormy weather during what was supposed to be a short trip from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore."Divers will continue to search for more bodies tomorrow," S.B. Supriyadi, a search and rescue agency official who has been coordinating the operation, told AFP.The Indonesian military, which has provided the bulk of personnel and equipment for the operation, withdrew from the search last week.
