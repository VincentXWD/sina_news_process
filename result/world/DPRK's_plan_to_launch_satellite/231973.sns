PYONGYANG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Media and officials of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday hailed the successful launch of a long-rang rocket that put an experimental satellite into orbit.  The country was overwhelmed by the excitement and happiness of the successful launch of the "Kwangmyongsong-2" satellite, an editorial carried by the official Rodong Sinmun daily on Tuesday said. The successful launch, "a great historical event, made a good start in the work of building a great prosperous powerful nation," it said. The editorial said the "magnificent feat" will consolidate the DPRK's position as "a country that could launch a satellite" and "a country possessing satellites," and "demonstrates to the world the dignity and power of the Korean nation." The state media also carried articles written by senior officials, like Jon Sung Hun, vice premier of the DPRK, and Kim Phyong Hae, Chief Secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), praising the launch. Head of the National Science Academy, Byon Yong Rib, said in an article that the "Kwangmyongsong-2" was "operating in good shape in orbit," which showed that "the DPRK has leapt forward in space technology." The DPRK said it successfully launched a communications satellite on Sunday. But the United Sates and South Korea said the launch was a failure with the second and third stages falling into the Pacific.
