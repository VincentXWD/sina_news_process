BRUSSELS, April. 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Friday condemned the "dangerous" rocket launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)."I am deeply concerned about the dangerous and destabilizing actions undertaken by the DPRK today," Ashton said in a statement."Regardless of its stated purpose, today's attempted launch is a clear violation of the DPRK's international obligations as set out in particular under UN Security Council Resolution 1874," she said.The DPRK launched a rocket carrying the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite at 07:38 a.m. local time (2238 GMT Thursday) at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Cholsan County, North Pyongan Province."The earth observation satellite failed to enter its preset orbit. Scientists, technicians and experts are now looking into the cause of the failure," the DPRK's official KCNA news agency reported.Ashton called upon the DPRK to abide by its obligations under relevant UN Security Council resolutions, its IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the NPT, and its commitments towards denuclearisation under the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six Party Talks."I also urge DPRK to refrain from any action that could further increase regional tensions," Ashton said.The EU foreign policy chief said the 27-state bloc was ready to continue working with its international partners to contribute to lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
