BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhuanet) -- China is calling for calm as the international community shows great concern over the DPRK’S satellite launch, to avoid further escalation of tension. CCTV reporter Hou Na reports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.A satellite or a ballistic missile?Friday morning’s rocket launch did not answer the question.Pyongyang said its satellite failed to enter its orbit.International condemnation followed.China is calling for everyone to stay calm.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Liu Weimin said, "We have noted the DPRK’S satelllite launch, and we have noted reactions from all parties of the international community. China calls for all parties concerned to stay calm and keep in close contact and dialogue with each other to avoid esclation of tension. W e should try our best to maintain the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."The launch has drawn wide international attention since the plans were announced.Earlier last week, in the Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meetings between China, Japan and South Korea, the three Ministers reached consensus to seek proper solutions through diplomatic channels and by peaceful means.Hou Na said, "China’s stance remained unchanged -- to maintain close communication and coordination with the parties involved and work with them to play a constructive role . But with growing condemnation of Pyongyang from the interantional community, it’s still unclear how the failed launch will affect peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the future of the Six-Party Talks.
