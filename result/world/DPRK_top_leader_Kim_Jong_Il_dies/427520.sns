SEOUL, December 30, 2011 - North Korea Friday ruled out policy changes and rejected any engagement with South Korea's current government, a day after proclaiming the son of late leader Kim Jong-Il as its new supreme chief."We solemnly and proudly declare, to foolish politicians in the world including South Korean puppets, that they should not expect any changes from us," the National Defence Commission (NDC) said in a statement on the official news agency.The North would "refuse forever to engage with traitor Lee Myung-Bak and his group", it said, referring to the South's president.The NDC, formerly chaired by Kim Jong-Il who died on December 17, is the country's top decision-making body. His son Jong-Un was declared "supreme leader of party and army and people" at a massive memorial service Thursday."The world shall clearly see how the millions of our soldiers and people, who united firmly round great leader comrade Kim Jong-Un to transform sorrow into courage and tears into strength, will achieve the final victory," the statement said.(Agencies)
