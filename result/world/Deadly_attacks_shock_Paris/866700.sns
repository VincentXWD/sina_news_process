The suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was caught on camera at a Metro train station in the capital on the night of the carnage, a police source said Friday.CCTV showed Abaaoud, who was killed in a police raid on an apartment on Wednesday, at the Croix de Chavaux station in the eastern district of Montreuil. The footage places him near to the Seat car found there that was used by the jihadists who attacked bars and restaurants, killing dozens.
