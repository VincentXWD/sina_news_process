Two bombs erupted at the famed Boston Marathon today, killing two people and injuring at least 99 while turning the race into what looked like a war zone.Within hours of the explosions, law enforcement officials, including those with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, were questioning a potential person of interest at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where many of the injured were taken, sources told ABC News.The casualties were caused by two bombs that exploded almost simultaneously near the race finish line on Boylston Street before 3 p.m. The area was crowded with runners and spectators, and thousands of runners were still completing the race at the time of the first explosion.Police said that two people were killed. At least 99 were taken to hospitals with injuries, including some which have been described as amputations and severe burns.(Agencies)
