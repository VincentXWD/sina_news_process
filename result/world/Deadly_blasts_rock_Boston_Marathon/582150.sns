The suspect was reportedly captured within two hours of the 2:50 pm bombing.Details of the bombing are still trickling out, and police said the events were still unfolding late Monday afternoon. Boston police commissioner Edward Davis backed down from calling the bombing a terrorist attack but told a reporter “you can reach your own conclusions.”The Boston Marathon was rocked by two explosions at the finish line on Monday, leaving at least 12 people dead and close to 50 injured. The injury totals have continued to rise throughout the afternoon however, and Massachusetts General Hospital said it is treating at least 10 people with amputated limbs.Police said the first explosion came from the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel, and another two undetonated explosive devices were found and dismantled by police. A third explosive device was found in JFK Library in Boston, police confirmed.“There were two bombs that exploded near the finish line in today’s Boston Marathon,” The Boston Marathon’s official Facebook page read. “We are working with law enforcement to understand what exactly has happened.”Gov. Deval Patrick issued a statement shortly after the Boston Marathon bombing.“This is a horrific day in Boston. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the President, Mayor Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around Copley Square is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from Copley Square and let the first responders do their jobs.”There was no word yet on the identity of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect.(Agencies)
