SYDNEY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell said on Tuesday Sydneysiders stand beside the people of Boston as they face the tragic bombing during the city's Marathon.He compared the world's oldest annual event to Sydney's City to Surf, which attracts more than 85,000 people."As a city that also has a major fun run, we express our solidarity, our sympathy, for the people of Boston who have gone through this terrible tragedy," O'Farrell said on Tuesday."To think that a great public event, which characterizes that city, has been interfered with in this way, this tragedy in which people lost their lives, including children, is appalling."Two bomb explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon have left at least three people dead and more than 100 injured.
