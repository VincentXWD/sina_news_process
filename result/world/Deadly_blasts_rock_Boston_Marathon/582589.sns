Both explosive devices used in the Boston Marathon attack appears to have been placed in metal pressure cookers packed with nails and ball bearings designed to amplify the damage from the explosions, CBS News reports.Investigators believe the bombs were hidden in black nylon backpacks and housed inside sealable metal pots called pressure cookers. Pressure cooker bombs can help boost the power of relatively small devices by briefly constraining the blast. And when the cookers do explode, they can add large chunks of metal to the shrapnel spray. The IEDs have been popular with terrorists. Al Qaeda published a how-to recipe in an online Jihadi magazine. Several of the bombs were used in the 2006 attack on trains in Mumbai, India.The details on the explosives emerged as the chief FBI agent in Boston made a public appeal for any tips to help identify suspects. At a news conference late Tuesday afternoon in Boston, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Richard Deslauriers, indicated that the range of suspect and motive is "wide open," and that the investigation is still in its "infancy." He also mentioned that the FBI had received about 2,000 tips as of noon as agents looked for any photographic or video evidence from witnesses.Deslauriers also said that both explosive devices appears to have been placed in a black nylon bag or backpack. A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that investigators also found pieces of an electronic circuit board possibly indicating a timer was used in the detonation of the bomb. Orr reports that investigators have now recovered pieces of the backpacks and the pressure cookers; however, at the moment, the FBI does not know how the bombs were triggered.(Agencies)
