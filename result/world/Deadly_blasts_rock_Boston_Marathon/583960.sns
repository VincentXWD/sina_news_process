Moscow and Washington may cooperate in investigating the Boston bombings if the two suspects are proved to be linked with Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Saturday."If all the circumstances and details get cleared, I think, our intelligence agencies will be in contact," Peskov said in an interview with Rossia 24 state TV channel.He said Russia has not yet received official confirmation of identities of the two bombings suspects, who reportedly came from the volatile North Caucasus.On Thursday, a spokesman for Russia's Chechnyan leader Ramzan Kadyrov said the two brothers grew up in a region near Chechnya but had little to do with the area since their family had left there many years ago.Dzhokhar Tsarnyev, 19, was taken into custody late Friday after a massive police manhunt which followed cross fires on Thursday night in which his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan, was shot and later died in a hospital.Two coordinated bombings hit near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing three people and injuring over 170. President Vladimir Putin offered his willingness to assist in the investigation a day after.
