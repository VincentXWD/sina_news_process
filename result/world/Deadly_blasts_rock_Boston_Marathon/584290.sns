Ethiopia's Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya triumphed at a somber London Marathon yesterday, as runners paid tribute to the victims of the deadly bomb attacks at the Boston Marathon.Kebede hunted down 2011 champion Emmanuel Mutai to win the men's race, while Jeptoo surged to victory in the women's event, eight months after finishing second at the London Olympics.The start was preceded by a 30-second silence in memory of the three people killed and around 180 injured in Monday's bombings in Boston, while competitors donned black ribbons in tribute. About 35,000 runners bowed their heads and observed a moment of reflection in memory of the victims.Organizers have pledged to donate 2 pounds (US$3) for every finisher to a fund for the Boston victims. Police presence along the 42.2-kilometer course was increased by 40 percent. Despite security fears, 700,000 people took to the streets of London to watch the race.British Olympic star Mo Farah had helped set the early pace before dropping out, as planned, after an hour.The 5,000 and 10,000 meters champion at last year's London Games is preparing to compete over the full distance next year, but he said he had struggled with the demands of marathon running.London Olympic champion Tiki Gelana collided with men's wheelchair athlete Josh Cassidy and the Ethiopian's challenge never recovered. American Tatyana McFadden claimed victory in the women's wheelchair event in a course record time to follow up her success in the equivalent race in Boston.Elsewhere, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya won the Hamburg Marathon. The 28-year-old Kipchoge set a new course record of 2 hours 05.30 minutes with Ethiopia's Limenih Getachew second, while Kenya's Lawrence Kimaiyo finished third.The Hamburg runners warmed up to the Boston Marathon's signature tune "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond while many ran with green and yellow wristbands bearing the inscription "Run for Boston".(Agencies)
