Boston suspect 'awake and responding to questions'

The surviving Boston marathon bomb suspect is beginning to respond to questions from investigators, reports say.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remains in critical but stable condition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, where some of the 180 people wounded in the blasts are also being treated.The 19-year-old is said to have a wound to his throat - reportedly caused by a gunshot through his mouth that exited the back of his neck - which prevents him from speaking.But major US news networks say he is responding to questions in writing.Dzhokhar is also reported to have been shot in the leg during a shootout with law enforcement the night before his arrest.His older brother and fellow suspect Tamerlan, 26, died in that gunfight.A lawyer for Tamerlan's wife, Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, said US authorities have also asked to speak with his client.Amato DeLuca said Mrs Russell Tsarnaev did not suspect her husband of anything, and nothing seemed amiss after the bombings.He said she had been working 70 to 80 hours a week as a home health care aide while her husband cared for their daughter.Mr DeLuca said on the day he died, Tamerlan was home when his wife left for work.After Tamerlan was killed early on Friday, Dzhokhar escaped, triggering an hours-long manhunt that shut down Boston.It ended with the teenager's capture in a boat parked in a backyard late on Friday night.It has also emerged that police chiefs fear the Tsarnaev brothers were planning further attacks.Commissioner Ed Davis said police found a huge stockpile of weapons."They had IEDS," he said, referring to improvised explosives devices."They had homemade hand grenades that they were throwing at the officers."The scene was loaded with unexploded improvised explosive devices that actually we had to point out to the arriving officers and clear the area."He said one IED was found in a Mercedes the brothers had abandoned."This was as dangerous as it gets in urban policing," Commissioner Davis said.He said federal authorities were trying to track down how and where the two suspects obtained the firearms and explosive devices.The two were ethnic Chechens who had been living in the United States for a decade.Dzhokhar became a US citizen in 2012, while his older brother's application was reportedly held up.Tamerlan began posting militant videos on social media sites in recent years, and travelled to Dagestan, which borders Chechnya, in 2012. Both Russian regions host separatist rebel groups.The brothers' social media pages appeared to express sympathy with the struggle in Chechnya, which has been ravaged by two wars since 1994 between Russia and increasingly Islamist-leaning separatist rebels.Three people died in the twin blasts at the marathon, the worst bombing to take place in the US since 9/11.Agencies
