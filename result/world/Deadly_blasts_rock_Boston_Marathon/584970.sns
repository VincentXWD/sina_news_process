They have a bomb and guns.'In an exclusive interview with MailOnline Egyptian born Ahmed, 44, said the victim was so scared he could barely stand and collapsed on the floor.Ahmed said that when the man went behind the counter to hide, he knew he was telling the truth.Ahmed dialed 911 and within minutes the area was flooded with police.The dramatic escape of the carjacking victim was the beginning of the end for the alleged bombers as they were found by police and involved in a fierce gun battle.Tamerlan was shot multiple times, while his brother was later found cowering in a covered-up boat and taken into custody.After encountering Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the terrified victim was shown a gun and forced into the passenger seat.After picking up his brother, and transferring guns and bombs into the trunk, the car spend off.Tamerlan was driving and his 19-year-old brother was in the rear passenger seat. The victim was in the front passenger seat.After being forced to hand over $45, they drove to an ATM where $800 was withdrawn from the victim's account.All three headed towards an all night Shell garage on Memorial Drive in Cambridge where Tamerlan pulled up alongside one of the gas pumps.Dzhokhar went inside - and was captured on the CCTV camera at the front of the store.The photograph was released by the FBI hours after the impromptu stop and gave law enforcement and members of the public a much clearer view of the alleged teen bomber.The image with Dzhokhar wearing a hoodie was clearer than those released earlier by the FBI which been taken prior to the bombs going off at the finish line of the marathon.Cashier Tarek Ahmed described how the Chinese victim burst into kiosk.'He was shaking, absolutely terrified and started shouting that some men had guns and they were trying to kill him,' he said.'He said they had a bomb. He was so scared that he could not stand up. He fell over and at first I thought he was drunk.'But then he got up and pushed his way to the back of the counter and said 'you have to hide me.'He kept saying there were men out there who wanted to kill him. I'ver never seen anyone so scared.Ahmed said the man hid behind a metal door in a back room and he again pleaded with him to call police.'I rang 911 and told them what happened. Within three minutes there were police cars here.'He added: I did not see who he was running from, but he was so scared.'Police spoke with the victim and were able to get a description of the car and it license plate.The victim told FBI agents he managed to escape while Tamerlan became distracted as his brother was in the store shopping.Neither brother made any attempt to kill the carjacking victim.After speeding away along Memorial Drive the stolen car was spotted by police in Watertown having been given its licence plate and description.They gave chase and in an ensuing gun battle where over 200 shots were fired 26 year old Tamerlan was hit multiple times.He was run over by his brother who fled in the stolen SUV, later abandoning it and taking refuge in a covered up boat.Police have said the believed the brothers were planning to go to New York with US officials convinced they were planning further bloodshed.Agencies
