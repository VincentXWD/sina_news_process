The two Boston bombing suspects had intended to come to New York to detonate bombs in Time Square, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told a press conference on Thursday.In a joint press conference with NYC Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, the mayor said NYC was the suspects' next target.New York "remains a prime target for those who hate" the U.S., said the mayor.Kelly said based on information from interrogators, the two suspects had planned to drive to New York after they hijacked a car in Boston and the remaining explosives were meant for Time Square.They made the decision to go to NYC in the car, he said, it was a "spontaneous decision."According to Kelly, the 19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators from his hospital bed in Boston that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had decided spontaneously last Thursday night to drive to New York and detonate their remaining explosives, including a pressure cooker bomb and five pipe bombs, in Time Square.Their plan was foiled after they realized that the vehicle they hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station.The carjacking victim escaped and called 911 and their car was intercepted by police. The two suspects were engaged in a gunbattle with police, which killed the older brother.Dzhokhar, who was wounded in the gunbattle, was captured alive on Friday from Boston's suburb Watertown. He is charged with carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others near the finish line of the Boston Marathon held on last Monday afternoon.
