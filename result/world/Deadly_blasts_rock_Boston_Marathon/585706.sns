Boston bombs detonated by 'toy car remote'

The two bombs that went off at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and wounding 264, were detonated with the kind of remote device used to control a toy car."It was a remote control for toy cars," US Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters after officials from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and National Center for Counterterrorism briefed the committee."Which says to me, and brother number two has said, they got the information on how to build the bomb from Inspire magazine," he said.Inspire was created by the American-Yemeni preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen who was killed in a US drone strike.Mr Ruppersberger said the article on bomb-building in Inspire was headlined: "How to build a bomb in your mom's kitchen."The devices were not sophisticated and had to be triggered within a few blocks of the explosives, officials told US media.Police say two brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, planted and detonated two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, lies wounded in a Boston hospital and has been providing some information to authorities.Mr Ruppersberger also confirmed that at least some of the explosives used in the attack had come from a fireworks shop in New Hampshire."One of the brothers, the oldest brother, went to a shop in New Hampshire ... and asked for the most volatile explosives, so that you'd 'get the best bang,'" Mr Ruppersberger said.The development came as two US officials said the surviving suspect in the Boston bombings was unarmed when police captured him hiding inside a boat in a neighbourhood back yard.Authorities originally said they had exchanged gunfire with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for more than one hour Friday evening before they were able to subdue him.The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation, said investigators recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, from the site of a gun battle Thursday night, which injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer. Dzhokhar was believed to have been shot before he escaped.The officials tell The Associated Press that no gun was found in the boat. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.(Agencies)
