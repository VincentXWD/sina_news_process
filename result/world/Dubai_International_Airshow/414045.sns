DUBAI, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Airbus scored the biggest deal of the second day of the Dubai Airshow as the Kuwait-based Aviation Lease and Finance Company, or ALAFCO, finalized a purchase order for 50 A320neo Family aircraft.ALAFCO also took options for 30 more to be finalized by the end of this year, according to the statement issued by the Airbus on Monday.The firm contract is an increase of the initial agreement made at this summer's Paris Le Bourget Airshow for 30 A320neo aircraft."The A320neo is the market's favorite single-aisle aircraft family," said Ahmed Al Zabin, ALAFCO Chairman. "The significant fuel burn savings it offers, combined with the operational reliability and cost effectiveness of the A320 Family, make it an absolute 'must have' in our portfolio to meet the demand and the requirements of our customers."The A320neo is a new engine option for the A320 Family entering into service from 2015. It uses 15 percent less fuel than older models of the single-aisle A320. This reduction in fuel burn is equivalent to 1.4 million litres of fuel -- the consumption of 1, 000 mid size cars.Over 8,100 A320 Family aircraft have already been ordered and more than 4,800 delivered to more than 340 customers and operators worldwide, according to the Airbus.
