Political pressure is growing here for the Hong Kong government to protect Edward Snowden, who has said he will remain in the city and allow the people here to “decide his fate.”Hong Kong has a separate legal system from Chinese mainland and an avowed devotion to free speech.Chanting slogans like “Shame, U.S. government,” demonstrators marched from a downtown park to the United States Consulate on Saturday to urge that Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking documents about American surveillance programs, be allowed to remain in Hong Kong.
