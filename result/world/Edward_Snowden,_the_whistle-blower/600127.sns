CHINA yesterday demanded that Washington explain its monitoring programs to the international community.Several nations, including United States allies, have reacted angrily to revelations by an ex-CIA employee over a week ago that US authorities had tapped the servers of Internet companies for personal data.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the US - which has complained about alleged cyber-espionage by China - owed the world an explanation."We believe the United States should pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation," Hua told reporters at a daily news briefing.The revelations of the US National Security Agency's spying programs were provided by Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor currently in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong.Snowden told the South China Morning Post last week that Americans had spied extensively on targets in China's mainland and Hong Kong. He said these included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the site of an exchange which handles nearly all the city's domestic web traffic.At the briefing, Hua rejected a suggestion that Snowden was a spy for China."This is sheer nonsense," she said.Her comments came after former US Vice President Dick Cheney said that he was "deeply suspicious" about Snowden's decision to go to China, although Hong Kong has its own legal system.Â
