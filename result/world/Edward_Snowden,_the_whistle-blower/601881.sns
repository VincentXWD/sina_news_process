China says it is "gravely concerned" over cyber attacks by US government agencies after new allegations they snooped on Chinese targets.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said yesterday the latest reports "again proved that China is the victim of cyber attacks, and we have already lodged representations to the US side," according to Xinhua news agency.The remarks followed claims by Edward Snowden made to Hong Kong's Sunday Morning Post that US spies had hacked Tsinghua University in Beijing - home to one of six "network backbones" that route all Internet traffic on China's mainland - and the Hong Kong headquarters of Pacnet, which operates one of the Asia-Pacific region's largest fiber-optic networks.Xinhua described the US as the world's "biggest villain" for IT espionage, after the new allegations emerged. "These, along with previous allegations, are clearly troubling signs," it said in a commentary."They demonstrate that the United States, which has long been trying to play innocent as a victim of cyber attacks, has turned out to be the biggest villain in our age," it said.The US and China are both victims of hacking and have to work together on the issue.But it stressed: "The ball is now in Washington's court. The US government had better move to allay the concerns of other countries."
