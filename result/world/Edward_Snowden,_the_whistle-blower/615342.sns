A member of the US Senate recently edited Snowden’s Wikipedia page from describing him as a ‘dissident’ to a traitor, according to the entry’s changelog. The user’s IP address was quickly traced back to the US Senate.It is not clear if the person is an active Senator, a staffer or an intern, but the change certainly came from the Senate.The attempted edit, made August 2, was rejected by a moderator on the grounds it ‘seemed less than neutral,’ according to the posted rejection, which also listed the IP address and showed it was registered to the US Senate.The edit came one day after Snowden was granted a one year asylum in Russia. (Agencies)
