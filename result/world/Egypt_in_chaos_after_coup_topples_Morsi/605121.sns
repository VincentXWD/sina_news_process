Egypt's armed forces overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi on Wednesday and announced a political transition with the support of a wide range of political, religious and youth leaders.After a day of drama in which tanks and troops deployed near the presidential palace as a military deadline for Mursi to yield to mass protests passed, the top army commander announced on television that the president had "failed to meet the demands of the Egyptian people".The chairman of Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court will run the country for a transitional period, Egypt's military chief announced in a televised speech on Wednesday, a decision that in essence removes embattled Mohamed Morsi from power.Talking about the military roadmap for a transitional period after the ouster of Morsi, Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said the army's roadmap includes forming a national government with broadened powers, and that the army will seriously face any unpeaceful act.The minister said the roadmap will include suspending the current constitution and forming a commission to prepare constitutional amendments."The armed forces understood the demands of the Egyptian people, " Sisi said, vowing that the armed forces will be committed to their responsibilities.He reiterated that the armed forces will always be out of politics, calling on all Egyptians to abstain from violence and resort to peacefulness.The army also calls for forming a national consensus commission from the public figures representing all movements and parties.Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed al-Tayyib and head of Orthodox Church Pope Tawadros II all hailed the military's roadmap.Speaking at a press conference, ElBaradei said the roadmap guarantees the fulfillment of the protesters' major demand, which is to hold early presidential elections."I hope that will mark the beginning of a new era for the 2011 January revolution," said ElBaradei.Meanwhile, Tawadros said the roadmap ensures security for all Egyptians, offers political vision.Celebratory yells are heard on Cairo's major streets and fireworks are seen above the iconic Tahrir Square after anti-Morsi protesters heard about Morsi's ouster.However, Morsi's supporters at Rabia al-Adawiya Square in Cairo 's Nasr City, remain defiant.(Agencies)
