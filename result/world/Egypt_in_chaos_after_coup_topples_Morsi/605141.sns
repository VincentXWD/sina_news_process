Egypt's ousted President Mohamed Morsi said he is still the legitimate president of Egypt in a prerecorded statement broadcast by pan-Arab Al Jazeera news channel on Wednesday evening."There is no alternative for legitimacy, the constitution or the law," Morsi repeated.Morsi's statement came after the military ousted him and assigned the chief of the Supreme Constitutional Court to temporarily run the country until a new president is elected."I am ready to sit with everyone for dialogue and negotiation," Morsi said, noting that changing legitimacy every few months means "disorder."Morsi, according to local sources, has been moved to an undisclosed location.Morsi reiterated that there is no other legitimacy than that of the constitution and the law, adding "I do not urge you to fight against each other. I order you not to fight together, but I do not accept to accept a new legitimacy."The military roadmap includes suspending the current constitution and forming a commission to prepare constitutional amendments, Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said.On his Facebook page, Morsi said the recently-announced military roadmap for running the country for a transitional period is "a complete military coup," calling on all people to stick to the law and the constitution."The army roadmap is rejected altogether by all free citizens," Morsi said, referring to himself as the president and the supreme leader of the armed forces despite the announced ouster by the military."The coup will pull Egypt backward," Morsi said, adding that " everyone has to bear their responsibilities before God, the people and the history."
