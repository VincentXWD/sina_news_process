CAIRO, July 4 (xinhua) -- The removal of Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi from power by the army Wednesday triggered mixed reactions from countries in the Middle East region.Following mass protests calling for Morsi to step down, the Egyptian army set 48 hours as a deadline for political forces to find a way out of the political standoff. When the military ultimatum expired, and after the embattled president in a televised speech insisted on staying in power, the defense minister announced a future roadmap that overthrew the Islamist- oriented head of state.Palestinian Hamas movement, whose supporters took to the streets of Gaza celebrating Morsi's victory in June 2012, said Wednesday that the ouster of the Egyptian president would not leave any impact on the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip.On Thursday, the Gaza Hamas-run government stated that it does not interfere in other states' internal affiars including the military ouster of Morsi. "We in the Gaza Strip do not intervene in the internal matters of any Arab or Islamic country, and this is our firm position," said Ziad AlZaza, the deputy prime minister of Hamas' government.On the other Palestinian side, the President Mahmoud Abbas Thursday congratulated Egypt's interim leader Adli Mansour, hoping that he would succeed in "achieving the people's demands of freedom, dignity, and stability."Mansour, the Egyptian Chief Justice, was sworn in Thursday morning as the interim head of state until a new president is elected.Praising the Army of Egypt, Abbas siad that "It maintained the security and prevented the country from sliding into an unknown future."The military roadmap was also hailed by the UAE's foreign minister, who said Wednesday that the Egyptian army had proven once again it is the "strong shield" that protects the country of institutions and rule of law."I am fully confident that the people of Egypt will be able to overcome the current difficult moments in order to reach a safe and prosperous future," Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed AlNahyan quoted by the official news agency WAM as saying.Syrian government, with which toppled Morsi cut off relations over Hezbollah involvement in Syria, Thursday congratulated in a statement the people of Egypt, calling upon them to "defend their victory.""Syria's People, army, and leadership extend sincere congratulations, blessings, and appreciation to the Egyptian people," the state-run news agency SANA cited the official statement.On a similar track, Morocco called for Egyptians to maintain national unity, stability, and security. "Taking note of the decisions of the Egyptian military for a transitional stage, Morocco stresses the need to preserve the national unity of this great country, it's security and stability," the Moroccan Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday.While hundreds of Tunisians celebrated the overthrow of Morsi outside the Egyptian embassy in the capital Tunis, the Islamic majority government has not commented on the move.On the opposite side, the Turkish ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) said the "military coup" in Egypt is a sign of "backwardness", which was supported by some foreign powers, according to AKP's spokesman Huseyin Celik. "We should see it as a blow inflicted directly on the people of Egypt," the vice president of the Turkish Islamic-inclined party told reporters.For his part, Turkey's main opposition People's Party (CHP) leader, Kemal Kililcdaroglu, said "Military coups cannot be accepted, I hope democracy will triumph soon."
