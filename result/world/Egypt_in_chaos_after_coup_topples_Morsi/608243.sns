The United States on Friday echoed a call for the release of Mohamed Morsi, the first elected president in Egypt removed from power by the military last week.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, in the Obama administration's first statement about the fate of Morsi, endorsed a call made by the German Foreign Ministry earlier in the day."We call for an end to the restrictions on Mr. Morsi's whereabouts," a German Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters."We do agree," Psaki said at a regular press briefing.Morsi was detained in a "safe place" following his ouster on July 3, one year after he assumed the presidency, over his failure to rein in mass protests against his "poor performance" and " maladministration."Psaki refused to say, however, whether Washington would recognize Morsi as the Egyptian president after his release."We, of course, recognize that President Morsi was democratically elected," she remarked. "It's about more than what happens at the ballot box. Most democratic transitions take years to take root and stabilize, especially following decades of autocratic rule.""And what we're focused on now is continuing to encourage that process to move forward by including all sides," she added. "We are working with the interim government."Egypt's interim President Adli Mansour on Monday outlined his timetable for the transitional period, under which parliamentary elections will be held within six months, followed by fresh presidential polls.Psaki said the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Morsi belongs, should be included in an "inclusive and sustainable democracy" in Egypt, as is the "fundamental goal" of the United States.She refused to "speculate on" whether Morsi's release would complicate the situation in Egypt.Right after Morsi was toppled, U.S. President Barack Obama called on the army to move "quickly and responsibly" to return " full authority" to an elected civilian government, and avoid "any arbitrary arrests" of Morsi and his supporters.
