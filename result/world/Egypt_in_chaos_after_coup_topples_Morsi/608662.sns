The lack of information on the whereabouts of Egypt's deposed president Mohamed Morsi since his ouster has prompted speculation both at home and abroad.The debate over his detention seems to get hotter following recent calls by the United States and Germany to release him."Transparency and clear situation about Morsi's legal status, either he is detained over charges or chooses willingly to be isolated, is a must now to avoid domestic disturbance or international interference," local security expert Fouad Alaam told Xinhua.It is the duty of the Egyptian interim government to brief the people about the legal procedures to be taken over the ousted president, said Alaam.Egypt's public prosecutor's office launched an inquiry Saturday into complaints against Morsi and other Islamist figures including the Brotherhood's leader Mohamed Badie.The complaints include spying, inciting violence and ruining the economy, although prosecutors did not say who had made the allegations.Haytham el-Shawaf, general coordinator of the Revolutionary Forces Coalition, said the army detained Morsi to avoid violence and retaliate operations by the Islamists.Despite the U.S. call for Morsi's release, Shawaf said he did not expect Washington to exert pressure by threatening the stop of aid to Egypt.Abdel Ghafar Shoker, political expert and head of the socialist Popular Coalition party, said Morsi's detention concerns Egypt's national security and the authorities should give a clear definition of his legal status as soon as possible so as to avoid perplexity at the political level.Samir Ghatas, chief of the Cairo-based Maqdes Center for Political Studies, echoed the idea. "He (Morsi) shouldn't be detained without explanations for the Egyptian citizens."However, he said calls by foreign countries to release Morsi were intervention in Egypt's domestic affairs, adding that such calls should be conveyed via diplomatic channels instead of in front of the media.
