Visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns held talks here Saturday with top Egyptian leaders and loyalists to ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi over recent developments in the turmoil-stricken country."The future of Egypt is only determined by its people without any foreign interference," said Burns at a joint press conference after meeting with Egypt's interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy in the capital Cairo.He added that he came to listen to the Egyptian government and different political forces, to provide possible aid that could end a state of polarization and division and work on convincing concerned parties to stop all forms of violence to reach comprehensive reconciliation.Fahmy said Egypt welcomes all foreign delegations to listen to their views, but the final decision can only be determined by the people and the government representing the state's supreme interests, national security and efforts to combat terrorism and violence.After meeting with interim President Adli Mansour, Burns, along with EU special envoy Bernardino Leon, met with Mohamed ElBaradei, Egypt's vice-president in charge of foreign relations."A solution to the current political crisis should be achieved without violence and within the framework of the constitution and the law," state-run news agency MENA quoted ElBaradei as saying.Later on, Burns met at a hotel with a delegation of the National Alliance for Supporting Legitimacy, a pro-Morsi alliance led by the deposed leader's Muslim Brotherhood, but he has not yet made any statement after the meeting.The U.S. senior diplomat has decided to extend his visit to Sunday to meet with Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who ousted Morsi in early July, as well as interim Prime Minister Hazem al-Beblawi, MENA quoted a diplomatic source as saying.The source added that Burns is also likely to meet with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, who is currently on a visit to Egypt.
