BEIJING, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The entire world is pinning considerable hopes and expectations on the Group of 20 (G20) summit that begins in the French resort of Cannes on Thursday.The summit is held at a time when the world economy is plagued by a number of difficulties. The United States is faced with huge trade and domestic deficits, the European countries are under the threat of the sovereign debt crisis, and emerging economies have to deal with the increasing pressures of inflation.Solidarity is fundamentally crucial for the world to persevere through the predicament. In an era of economic integration and interdependancy, the current complex situation requires major economies to face up to challenges and make joint efforts to ensure common development.The G20 summit has served as a major platform for coordinating economic policies since the global economy began to falter over a chain of events, including the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that erupted in 2008 and the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis. It is widely hoped that the tradition of solidarity is carried on at the Cannes summit.The leaders gathering in Cannes need to sit down and seek the root causes of the economic maladies in a rational manner, instead of trading accusations.The most pressing issue is how to effectively address the lingering European debt crisis, which first broke out in Greece two years ago, has hit Ireland and Portugal and it is threatening to spill over to Italy and Spain, two major European economies.The G20 summit is an opportunity to seek solidarity in dealing with the debt crisis. It provides a platform for non-European members to offer political support to the European countries.In times of difficulty, each country is faced with the task of taking respective measures to alleviate investors' anxiety and create a better external environment.In seeking solidarity at the G20 summit, participants should also keep in mind the task of reforming the international financial system, strengthening financial regulation, and solving the fundamental problems which gave rise to the crises. A strong world economic growth requires measures to address some fundamental flaws in the developed economies.G20 members' fruitful efforts in dealing with the world's financial and economic woes in the past testify to the importance of coordination and common commitments to economic growth. This time in Cannes, everyone hopes this positive tradition could carry on.
