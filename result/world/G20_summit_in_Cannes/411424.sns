CANNES, France, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) gathered in the French resort city of Cannes, for a two-day summit which has been largely dominated by the aggravating debt crisis in Greece.French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose country holds the G20 presidency this year, had a working session Thursday morning with several eurozone leaders from Germany, Spain and Italy as well as European Union leaders prior to the start of the summit.The special meeting, dubbed a mini eurozone summit by some, dragged on past noon, and forced European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to cancel their scheduled press conference after postponing it twice within two hours.The summit was scheduled to seek consensus and cooperation among the world’s major developed and emerging economies in strengthening global financial regulation, reforming international monetary system and stimulating global economic growth.However, the confusion fuelled by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s surprise call for a Greek referendum on the latest aid package for Athens had pushed the eurozone debt crisis into the spotlight of this year’s G20 summit.Papandreou on Wednesday said the referendum might be held on Dec. 4, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urging Greece to have the referendum as soon as possible to clear uncertainties.
