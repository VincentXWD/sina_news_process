ATHENS, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek public and media kept an eye on the developments at the crucial G20 summit in Cannes on Friday amid domestic political turmoil.The top issue in the Greek media and the streets of Athens on Friday was the political crisis triggered by Prime Minister George Papandreou who made a surprise announcement on Monday of a referendum on the EU bailout pact hammered last week."G20 summit overshadowed by Greek crisis" was the headline of finance news daily "Naytemporiki" (Shipping Trade News), which highlighted that the dramatic developments in Greece over the past week created more headaches for leaders who try to avoid a domino effect across Europe."Action now is the message of G20 member countries to EU leaders," declared "Ta Nea" (The News) daily in an extensive report, stressing that the European debt crisis has alarmed the world and leaders examined plans to support the eurozone through the International Monetary Fund.In another report the newspaper "Kathimerini" (Daily) noted that leaders in Cannes praised the initial positive messages from Athens on Thursday afternoon that government and opposition could reach consensus to implement the critical decisions of the October 26 EU summit to protect Greece from default.However, ordinary people are still gripped by a sense of uncertainty facing their country."I really can not understand how can it be possible? Party leaders here fight over a deal that could save us at the moment from bankruptcy, while foreign leaders in Cannes discuss our future. I am worried about the next day and the future of my grandchildren," pensioner Maria Nikolidaga told Xinhua with her grand daughter in arms.Yannis Chryssanthakopoulos, a kiosk owner, said that "we have somehow managed to create a tsunami that threatens Europe and the world economy and while we are on a sinking Titanic, foreigners take back the life-jackets they gave us at first place, because they are fed up with us."The middle-aged Chryssanthakopoulos believed Greek and EU leaders has missed the best chance to fight the crisis two or three years ago.Greeks should now try again to put their house in order and work united to have a saying in matters that affect them, such as the issues discussed in Cannes.
