Clinton preps to leave, Obama doesn't mince words on praise

US President Barack Obama lauded Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as one of his closest advisers and said their shared vision for America's role in the world persuaded his one-time rival - and potential successor - to be his top diplomat while he dealt with the shattered economy at home.During a joint interview that aired on Sunday, Obama and Clinton chuckled as they described their partnership and stoked speculation that Obama may prefer Clinton to succeed him in the White House after the 2016 elections.Clinton is leaving Obama's Cabinet soon, and speculation about the former first lady and US senator has only grown more intense after a heated appearance last week on Capitol Hill in which she was questioned by lawmakers about the September 11 attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya.Both Obama and Clinton batted away questions about future campaigns, but the joint interview - the president's first with anyone other than first lady Michelle Obama - was only likely to increase the fascination with Clinton's future."The president and I care deeply about what's going to happen for our country in the future," Clinton said. "And I don't think, you know, either he or I can make predictions about what's going to happen tomorrow or the next year."Obama, who suggested the joint interview as Clinton prepared her exit from the State Department, lavished praise on his rival for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. He called her a friend and an extraordinary talent, and praised "her discipline, her stamina, her thoughtfulness, her ability to project."It teetered on an endorsement of a 2016 presidential bid that is still an open question. Clinton advisers say she has not made a decision about a run, while Democratic officials suggest Clinton would be an early favorite if she decided to mount another campaign. Obama and Clinton laughed when asked about the political future."You guys in the press are incorrigible," Obama said when pressed on another Clinton presidency. "I was literally inaugurated four days ago. And you're talking about elections four years from now."Obama described why he insisted Clinton become his secretary of state."She also was already a world figure," he said. "To have somebody who could serve as that effective ambassador in her own right without having to earn her stripes, so to speak, on the international stage, I thought, would be hugely important."It was a job she initially refused. But Obama kept pushing, Clinton said."The one thing he did mention was he basically said: 'You know, we've got this major economic crisis that may push us into a depression. I'm not going to be able to do a lot to satisfy the built-up expectations for our role around the world. So you're going to have to get out there and, you know, really represent us while I deal with, you know, the economic catastrophe I inherited."It's a job she embraced during the last four years. She arrived on the job with a global brand she quickly lent to promoting US interests. In return, the public rewarded her with high approval ratings that could come in handy if she runs in 2016.Obama praised Clinton's State Department for helping him sort out what the US can - and cannot - accomplish."It has been a great collaboration over the last four years. I'm going to miss her. Wish she was sticking around. But she has logged in so many miles, I can't begrudge her wanting to take it easy for a little bit," Obama said.It's something of a turnaround from 2007 and 2008, as the two raced through Iowa and New Hampshire and onward in a drawn-out primary campaign. In increasingly bracing language, the two excoriated each other. At one point, a visibly angry Clinton seethed, "Shame on you, Barack Obama."Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appear in joint '60 Minutes' interviewPresident Barack Obama said Hillary Clinton will go down "as one of the finest secretaries of state" as he sat next to her in their first joint interview Sunday night on CBS's 60 Minutes."I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say thank you because I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretary of states we've had," Obama says in the interview, recorded Friday at the White House, as Clinton smiles beside him."It has been a great collaboration over the last four years. I'm going to miss her. I wish she was sticking around."Such a love-in would have seemed unimaginable in 2008, when Obama and Clinton were locked in a brutal, bruising primary battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.The 60 Minutes interview aired on the fifth anniversary of the weekend Obama handily defeated Clinton in the South Carolina primary. That contest followed a particularly nasty leadup, when Bill Clinton angered African-Americans in the state when the former president, campaigning for his wife, described Obama's candidacy as a "fairy tale."Clinton herself acknowledged that their joint interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes was extraordinary considering the nature of their primary brawls."A few years ago it would have been seen as improbable because we had that very long, hard primary campaign," she said in an excerpt released over the weekend by CBS."And then President Obama asked me to be secretary of state and I said yes. And why did he ask me and why did I say yes? Because we both love our country."While admitting that their respective staffs may have had a difficult time getting over rancor from the 2008 primary, Obama said that it was not as hard for him.The president said that even before they both ran for president, he had admired Clinton's "discipline, her thoughtfulness, her ability to project and make issues that were clear." Those attributes, as well as her standing as "already a world figure," made her a smart choice for secretary of state - even if she didn't initially jump at the opportunity."We're both gluttons for punishment," she said jokingly of her decision to take the job despite numerous global challenges and the president having his hands full dealing with an economic crisis at home.Obama said he had always respected Clinton and knew she would excel, but what changed over the years is that they became "strong" friends.It was a sentiment echoed by Clinton, who described her relationship with her boss as "very warm, close.""I think there's a sense of understanding that sometimes doesn't even take words," she said.As a former popular first lady, U.S. senator and now secretary of state, experts say Clinton is well-positioned to be the Democratic frontrunner if she seeks a White House bid in 2016."I am still secretary of state. So I'm out of politics," Clinton said carefully, leaving herself the option of reviving her career once she leaves government. A woman who has devoted much of her life to public service, as first lady and as a New York senator, she stressed she still cared "deeply about what's going to happen for our country in the future."Clinton said neither Obama nor "I can make predictions about what's going to happen tomorrow or the next year," in comments bound to rekindle speculation that she could be preparing a 2016 run.(Agencies)
