Paul Ryan, former Republican vice presidential candidate, has said that if Hillary Clinton had been US President, the nation would have not had that fiscal crisis it is facing now. "We would have fixed this fiscal mess by now”, he said in a TV interview last Sunday.“Look, if we had a [Hillary] Clinton presidency, … I think we would have fixed this fiscal mess by now," Ryan said appearing on one of American national channels. "[But] that’s not the kind of presidency we’re dealing with right now.”“I don't think that the president thinks we actually have a fiscal crisis,” Ryan explained his position.The remark was “noteworthy”, as US mass media describe it, since both Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton, the outgoing Secretary of State, may have run for the country’s top post in 2016. However, none of them has confirmed their 2016 plans so far.(Agencies)
