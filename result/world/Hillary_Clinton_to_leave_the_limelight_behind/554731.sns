Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appear in joint '60 Minutes' interview

President Barack Obama said Hillary Clinton will go down "as one of the finest secretaries of state" as he sat next to her in their first joint interview Sunday night on CBS's 60 Minutes."I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say thank you because I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretary of states we've had," Obama says in the interview, recorded Friday at the White House, as Clinton smiles beside him."It has been a great collaboration over the last four years. I'm going to miss her. I wish she was sticking around."Such a love-in would have seemed unimaginable in 2008, when Obama and Clinton were locked in a brutal, bruising primary battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.The 60 Minutes interview aired on the fifth anniversary of the weekend Obama handily defeated Clinton in the South Carolina primary. That contest followed a particularly nasty leadup, when Bill Clinton angered African-Americans in the state when the former president, campaigning for his wife, described Obama's candidacy as a "fairy tale."Clinton herself acknowledged that their joint interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes was extraordinary considering the nature of their primary brawls."A few years ago it would have been seen as improbable because we had that very long, hard primary campaign," she said in an excerpt released over the weekend by CBS."And then President Obama asked me to be secretary of state and I said yes. And why did he ask me and why did I say yes? Because we both love our country."While admitting that their respective staffs may have had a difficult time getting over rancor from the 2008 primary, Obama said that it was not as hard for him.The president said that even before they both ran for president, he had admired Clinton's "discipline, her thoughtfulness, her ability to project and make issues that were clear." Those attributes, as well as her standing as "already a world figure," made her a smart choice for secretary of state - even if she didn't initially jump at the opportunity."We're both gluttons for punishment," she said jokingly of her decision to take the job despite numerous global challenges and the president having his hands full dealing with an economic crisis at home.Obama said he had always respected Clinton and knew she would excel, but what changed over the years is that they became "strong" friends.It was a sentiment echoed by Clinton, who described her relationship with her boss as "very warm, close.""I think there's a sense of understanding that sometimes doesn't even take words," she said.As a former popular first lady, U.S. senator and now secretary of state, experts say Clinton is well-positioned to be the Democratic frontrunner if she seeks a White House bid in 2016."I am still secretary of state. So I'm out of politics," Clinton said carefully, leaving herself the option of reviving her career once she leaves government. A woman who has devoted much of her life to public service, as first lady and as a New York senator, she stressed she still cared "deeply about what's going to happen for our country in the future."Clinton said neither Obama nor "I can make predictions about what's going to happen tomorrow or the next year," in comments bound to rekindle speculation that she could be preparing a 2016 run.(Agencies)
