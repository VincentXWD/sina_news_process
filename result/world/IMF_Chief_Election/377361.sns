WASHINGTON â€“ The IMF board on Monday shortlisted French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens for the IMF top job and disqualified Israel's Stanley Fischer due to his age, two board officials told Reuters.The officials, who requested anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made official, said there was not enough support to change the fund's rules to allow the 67-year-old Fischer, Israel's central bank governor, to run. IMF rules carry an age limit for first-time managing directors of 65 or older.
