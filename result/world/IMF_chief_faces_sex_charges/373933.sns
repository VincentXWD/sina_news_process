IMF chief gets new bail hearing, mug shot released

NEW YORK - IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn for a second time will request release on $1 million cash bail on Thursday and placement under 24-hour house arrest while he awaits trial on charges of attempting to rape a hotel maid, his lawyers said.The request by the global finance leader will call for him to be subjected to electronic monitoring, his lawyers said. He is being held in New York's notorious Rikers Island jail."Yes there will definitely be a bail hearing tomorrow," Manhattan District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Erin Duggan told Reuters.A mug shot of Strauss-Kahn, 62, taken more than 24 hours after he was pulled from an plane and detained on Saturday, showed him exhausted, his eyes downcast and half-closed and wearing a rumpled, open-neck shirt.The photograph may fuel outrage in France over how a man who had been viewed as a strong contender for the French presidency has been paraded before the cameras before he has had a chance to defend himself in court.Polls released in France on Wednesday showed 57 percent of respondents thought the Socialist politician was definitely or probably the victim of a plot.The woman who Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to rape, a 32-year-old widow from West Africa, testified on Wednesday before a grand jury and she was exhausted afterward, her lawyer said. The grand jury decides in secret whether there is enough evidence against Strauss-Kahn to formally press charges with an indictment."The proceedings are ongoing," the lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said.Strauss-Kahn's arrest has dashed his prospects to run for the French presidency in 2012 and raised broader issues over the future of the International Monetary Fund. Developing countries are questioning Europe's hold on the top IMF position, and jockeying to replace him has already begun -- even though he has not resigned.IMF board officials have told Reuters they were waiting for Strauss-Kahn to be indicted, possibly on Friday, before they move to contact him to hear his views on his post.Timeline EmergesNew details emerged on Wednesday about the sequence of events surrounding the alleged sexual attack on the maid.Strauss-Kahn left the Sofitel near Times Square in Manhattan around 12:30 pm (1630 GMT) on Saturday and roughly an hour later, hotel security called police to report an alleged sexual assault, a law enforcement source said.New York investigators are questioning why officials at the Sofitel waited an hour to call police after the IMF chief left the hotel in a hurry following the alleged assault.He has been charged with attempted rape, sexual abuse, a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. The woman he is accused of assaulting is an asylum seeker from Guinea with a 15-year-old daughter.In the only public hint of Strauss-Kahn's possible line of defense, his attorney Benjamin Brafman told his arraignment hearing on Monday that the evidence "will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."Any trial could be six months or more away.The United States, the IMF's biggest shareholder, said Strauss-Kahn was unable to carry on being chief of the global lender from a jail cell, whatever the legal outcome.　[1]　[2]　[Next]
