Strauss-Kahn case sparks debate about French media

Since Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest on allegations of sexual assault, the French media have been under pressure. They are accused, chiefly by the US press, of cowardly observing a "code of silence" over politicians' private lives; of either burying or failing to properly investigate the Socialist presidential frontrunner's long-rumoured predatory nature toward women.The debate has consumed the French commentariat, with many political editors insisting that they allude as much as possible to Strauss-Kahn's reputation as a seducer, within the bounds of France's strong libel and privacy laws and cultural view of sex being a politician's private business.One political editor suggested it was French politicians who should be taken to task. Many had long-whispered that sexual behaviour might bring Strauss-Kahn down during the presidential campaign – if they had evidence that his behaviour was potentially criminal, they should have spoken out, the editor said.Nicholas Demorand, editor of the daily Liberation, said his paper would continue to respect politicians' privacy. "It's a democratic principle – hypocritical in some people's eyes, but fundamental ... Ditching this principle would lead to encouraging short-term buzz and trash over quality news."Others warned that close links between journalists and politicians led to self-censorship, with the fear of being denied crucial access preventing reporters from exposing inappropriate behaviour.The chasm between the US and French media was clear in a row over images of Strauss-Kahn since his arrest. The IMF head was filmed unshaven and in handcuffs being escorted by New York police before his court appearance. These images were broadcast all over the world – except in France, where one of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers threatened legal action against channels broadcasting them. The CSA, the government's media watchdog, warned to use "the greatest restraint" in broadcasting them because the French law on presumption of innocence does not allow suspects to be shown in handcuffs.French state TV has since made limited use of the scenes of Strauss-Kahn in court and is now avoiding the handcuffed shots. Other French channels said it would be absurd not to use them when they were broadcast online and across the world.New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, agreed the display of Strauss-Kahn being led by police was humiliating and would be unfair if a defendant was proved to be innocent. "But if you don't want to do the 'perp walk', don't do the crime," he added.US media have criticised the French for showing more compassion for Strauss-Kahn than for the alleged rape victim, whose identity some French newspapers have published. The feminist French lawyer Gisèle Halimi, praised the US justice system, which she said protected women's dignity. "I am convinced that if this affair had taken place in France, we would never have heard anything about it," she told Le Parisien.(Agencies)
