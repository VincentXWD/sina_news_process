France seeks G8 support for IMF top job

DEAUVILLE, France, May 26 (Xinhua) -- France is to gather support for the country's bid to retain the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it hosts a summit of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations on Thursday.Though not on the official agenda of the two-day meeting, a new leader for the IMF was widely expected to feature high at the annual talks of the G8 leaders in the northern French seaside resort of Deauville.Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, resigned from the post of IMF's managing director last week following his dramatic arrest in New York for sexual assault allegations, which has thrust the issue of IMF leadership to the forefront much sooner than expected.France acted swiftly to Strauss-Kahn's leave. The country's current Finance Minister Christine Lagarde launched her bid Wednesday to head the IMF.Lagarde had been tipped to be the favorite European choice to succeed Strauss-Kahn, despite the fact that the former lawyer and synchronized swimming champion is also French.There is no surprise Lagarde's candidacy was quickly endorsed by the 27-nation European Union (EU), which hopes to maintain the leadership in the IMF at a time when the eurozone countries are struggling with a sovereign debt crisis.The IMF, Washington-based global lender of last resort, has played a crucial role in helping Europe tackle the crisis. So far it has pledged billions of euros to bail out debt-laden eurozone members like Greece, Ireland and the latest Portugal."I fully endorse the candidacy of Mrs Christine Lagarde for the post of Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement released moments after Lagarde announced her decision to run.With full backing of the 27-nation EU, France, the host, aims to gather further support from other partners, notably the United States, at the G8 summit.If appointed, Lagarde would be the first woman to head the IMF.However, many from developing economies are pushing for an end to the arrangement whereby the top IMF job always goes to a European, while the World Bank is led by an American.Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, or BRICS countries, issued a joint statement on Tuesday, rejecting that the successor to Strauss-Kahn should continue to be a European.The new global economy requires "abandoning the obsolete unwritten convention that requires that the head of the IMF be necessarily from Europe," they said.A potential contender to Lagarde now is Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens, the only declared candidate from developing countries.China said Thursday that the IMF chief should be chosen through consultation with a merit-based and transparent selection process.The selection of IMF leaders and high-level executives is a part of reforming the structure of international financial organizations, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said when responding to a question about China's position on the next IMF managing director.Citing a consensus reached by G20 leaders, Jiang said the selection should also seek to increase the presence of emerging markets and better reflect the changes in the global economic layout, but she did not talk about China's preference toward the candidates.Neither has Washington, the IMF's largest single shareholder, made its position clear.U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said both Lagarde and Carstens were very credible candidates, but he appeared to give Lagarde more credit, praising her as "an exceptionally capable person, an excellent mix of financial, economic knowledge, talent and the kind of political skills you need."
