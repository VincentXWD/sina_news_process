PARIS -- A French writer will file a legal complaint against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday alleging that he tried to rape her during an incident nine years ago, her lawyer told Reuters.Lawyer David Koubbi said the complaint by Tristane Banon, 32, would relate to an incident that took place when she went to interview Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, in an apartment in Paris. She was 22 at the time."Tristane Banon will file a complaint on Tuesday for attempted rape in Paris," Koubbi said."These acts are extremely serious," he added. "These events were combined with a violence that was absolutely striking for these kinds of situations."The move by Banon, a journalist and author of a book and two novels, will follow Strauss-Kahn's release from house arrest in New York on Friday after prosecutors there said they doubted the credibility of a hotel maid who alleged he tried to rape her.Koubbi would not say whether the timing was affected by the developments in New York, which suggest the case there is unravelling. Until his May arrest, Strauss-Kahn, who  was seen as the left's best chance of winning the 2012 election.Under French law, a complaint of attempted rape can be brought up to 10 years after an alleged attack, whereas sexual assault charges expire after three years.Koubbi had said several times in recent weeks that his client was considering taking action against Strauss-Kahn for the incident, which he said on Monday took place in early 2003, not in 2002 as had previously been reported.Baron's mother Anne Mansouret, a Socialist councillor, has said she regrets talking her out of filing a complaint at the time.The incident first surfaced publicly in 2007, when Banon discussed it in graphic detail on a television talk show, albeit with Strauss-Kahn's name bleeped out.During the TV talk show, which has been widely circulated online in recent weeks, Banon said he had insisted on holding her hand during the interview before making advances that led to her fighting him off as he tried to undo her clothing.(Agencies)
