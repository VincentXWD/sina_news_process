NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. prosecutors will eventually drop the charges against former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the New York Post said Tuesday.Quoting an unnamed top investigator in the sexual assault case, the paper said the eventual dismissal is "a certainty.""We all know this case is not sustainable," said the source, who is at the center of the investigation and would speak only on the condition of anonymity."Her credibility is so bad now, we know we cannot sustain a case with her," the source said, referring to the Guinean hotel maid who accused Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her in a luxury Manhattan hotel suite."She is not to be believed in anything that comes out of her mouth -- which is a shame, because now we may never know what happened in that hotel room," said the source.In a brief hearing at State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Friday, the judge freed Strauss-Kahn from house arrest. Prosecutors acknowledged that there were significant credibility issues with the hotel housekeeper .The release marks a stunning change of fortune for Strauss-Kahn, who was regarded as a leading candidate for the French presidency before the sexual assault case emerged and made international headlines, leading to his resignation as the IMF's managing director.
