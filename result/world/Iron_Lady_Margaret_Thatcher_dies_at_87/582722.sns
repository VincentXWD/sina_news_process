Thousands of police officers are being sent to streets in London on Wednesday for the security of the funeral procession for former British prime minister Baroness Thatcher.Thatcher's funeral is to take place at St Paul's Cathedral in London at 10:00 local time on Wednesday morning. It is reportedly the first funeral of a British politician attended by the Queen since that of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965.Security for the funeral is likely to be extremely tight with fears of disruption by Irish republican dissidents and far-left groups, according to local media.In the last 24 hours, hundreds of police officers have been patrolling the streets with sniff dogs trained to detect explosives.The security operation for the funeral and procession will be a mix of plain clothes and high visibility policing, according to former Scotland Yard Specialist Commander Roy Ramm.Concerns about potential violence rose after trouble erupted at several street parties celebrating her death on Monday night in London, Liverpool, Bristol and Glasgow.Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister and longest serving prime minister of the 20th century, died on Monday aged 87 after suffering a stroke. She had suffered dementia for more than a decade.More than 2,000 people are expected to attend to the funeral, including world leaders and dignitaries from 170 countries.A coffin bearing the former leader's body will travel by hearse to the church of St. Clement Danes, before being borne on a horse-drawn gun carriage to the cathedral, where 2,300 invited guests will await.
