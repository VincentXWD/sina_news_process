RAMALLAH, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of "negative consequences" if he goes again to seek symbolic recognition from the United Nations.On Tuesday night, Clinton phoned Abbas and informed him about the Obama administration's position that opposes any unilateral Palestinian bid for the United Nations, an official from Abbas' office said on condition of anonymity.Clinton recommended Abbas to work on reviving peace negotiations with Israel, which stopped over a dispute on Jewish settlement building in 2010, the official said.The Palestinians say they will go the General Assembly this year to upgrade the Palestinian status to a non-member state in the international organization. Last year, the Palestinians failed to get enough votes to obtain a full membership via the Security Council, blaming U.S. pressure for not mustering enough votes.According to the official, Clinton said she is talking with the Israeli government through the Quartet group, which also comprises Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, to present a new package of facilities as incentives to the Palestinians to resume negotiations.But Abbas has told Clinton that he is determined to go to the United Nations because negotiations with Israel were useless, the Palestinian official said.Earlier, Palestinian officials said that the U.S. Congress has a draft resolution of sanctions against the Palestinians ready to be passed if they went to the United Nations.The sanctions include halting U.S. financial aid to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and closing Washington office of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
