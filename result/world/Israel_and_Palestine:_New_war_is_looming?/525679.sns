The Palestinians are set to present their bid for the status of an observer state in the United Nations on Nov. 29, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said here Monday evening.Abbas made the remarks after meeting with Arab League (AL) chief Nabil al-Arabi in Cairo during an AL ministerial meeting on the Syrian crisis.Hailing the bid as a Palestinian "inborn right," Abbas asserted that the Palestinians do not want any confrontation with Israel, calling for the support of his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama."We have made continuous efforts to win a majority all over the world for our bid," said Abbas, asking for help from all Arab countries.The Palestinian bid for a full UN membership last year failed as they did not garner enough support at the Security Council amid U.S. opposition.
