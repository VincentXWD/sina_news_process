After a quite night, Israel has started Day Five of its Pillar of Cloud operation to suppress rocket fire from Gaza.Overnight, the Hamas rocket fire was conspicuous by its absence. Having already learned harsh lessons, the militants apparently feared easy detection by nighttime vision devices as the civilians stayed in shelters.Shortly after daybreak, however, a Hamas rocket damaged all four stories of a residential building in the southern Israeli town of Ashkelon.Fortunately, the residents had moved to their air raid shelter, and no one was hurt in the hit. The incident demonstrated that Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system is not that helpful in real war circumstances. It is also costly, to the tune of $60,000 per one intercepted hostile missile.The night saw 80 Israeli air raids aimed at disabling Hamas rocket launching sites and destroying Hamas stockpiles of Iranian-made missiles which can fly as far as Tel Aviv.These raids also damaged the head office of Hamas’s Al Quds television network, injuring six people including three Palestinian journalists.
