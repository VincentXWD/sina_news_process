A member of the Palestinian parliament will visit China to discuss the violence in Gaza, Beijing's Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday, as fighting continued to rage in the region.Bassam al-Salhi, the general secretary of the Palestinian People's Party and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, will visit China on Thursday for two days, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing."The two sides will exchange views" on China-Palestinian relations as well as the current situation in Gaza, Hua said of the visit.Repeating earlier Chinese calls for an end to violence in the region, Hua also urged "relevant parties, in particular the Israeli side, to exercise maximum restraint, realise an immediate ceasefire and avoid escalation of tension."Previous diplomatic efforts have failed to result in a deal to end Israel's offensive on rocket-firing militants in the Gaza Strip, part of of violence that has cost 136 Palestinian and five Israeli lives.(Agencies)
