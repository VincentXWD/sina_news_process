"But we are honoured to announce that we gave them the technology of how to make Fajr-5 missiles and now they have their hands on plenty of them."Jafar's remarks are a rare admission by such a high profile regime official that Tehran has supported Hamas militarily.On Saturday, Hamas claimed to have fired a Fajr-5 missile at Tel Aviv, Israel's second most populous city, but Israel said the rocket was shot down by an anti-missile battery. Iranian officials initially distanced themselves from accusations they were supplying Hamas but now appear to be boasting about their role in enabling Palestinians to build their own Fajr-5 missiles, which have a range of up to 46.6 miles (75km).Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an influential MP who heads the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, had said at the weekend that the accusations were unfounded.But the Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, echoed Jafari's comments on Wednesday in saying that Tehran's support for Palestinians had military dimensions.It was not clear from Larijani's comment whether Iran had actually smuggled Fajr-5 missiles into the Gaza Strip or if he merely went as far as the commander's remarks.Obama commends Israeli PM for agreeing to ceasefireU.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday commended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for agreeing to the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, the White House said in a statement.According to the White House statement, Obama recommended Netanyahu agree to the ceasefire, while reiterating that Israel maintains the right to defend itself.EU hails Gaza ceasefireTop leaders of the European Union (EU) hailed the ceasefire in Gaza on Wednesday soon after it was proclaimed."We welcome wholeheartedly the cease-fire that has just been proclaimed in Gaza and that was being strongly called for by the European Union and the international community," said a statement jointly issued by the European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and the European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso."It is now crucial to ensure its implementation and to prevent the restart of violence," it said.The statement said that the events of the last days stress the urgent need to move towards a two-state solution allowing both sides to live side-by-side in peace and security, and the EU remains determined to continue working to assist in achieving this goal.The EU leaders also expressed their deep sorrow for the loss of lives on both sides resulting from this outbreak of violence.UN chief hails Gaza truce, commends Egypt for ceasefire effortsUN Secretary-general Ban Ki- moon on Wednesday welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and commended Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi for leading the efforts to reach the ceasefire."I warmly welcome today's ceasefire announcement," said Ban while briefing the UN Security Council via video link from the Tel Aviv airport.
