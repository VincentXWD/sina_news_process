CAIRO, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon praised here Wednesday the efforts of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in mediating the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Gaza, official news agency MENA reported."I support Morsi's efforts in the ceasefire agreement," he said, adding that this was the main topic he discussed in Cairo, Israel, and Ramallah.He also said he discussed with Morsi the bus explosion in Tel Aviv Wednesday, expressing his condemnation for such attacks against civilians."The military ways will necessarily lead to more misery, so we urge the need for an immediate fire ceasing," he said.Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel Amr announced Wednesday evening that the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza militant groups will take effect at 9:00 p.m. Cairo time (1900 GMT) on Wednesday.Ban stressed the necessity of delivering humanitarian aids to Gaza, adding that the United Nations will do its best in this regard.The UN chief also emphasized the exigency of the two-state solution that can be achieved via negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians."We depend on Egypt to achieve such a goal," he said, adding that the results of his Middle East tour will be reported to the Security Council via a teleconference.Ban came back to Cairo Wednesday afternoon after leaving Tuesday for Israel and Ramallah, where he talked with leaders on the two sides about ways to stop violence in the Gaza Strip and the ceasefire agreement.In a bid to end the escalating deadly conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, Ban arrived in Egypt Monday to discuss the latest developments in the region with senior Egyptian officials.Nearly 150 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,200 wounded in Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip during the past eight days, while five Israelis were killed due to rockets fired by Gaza militants.
