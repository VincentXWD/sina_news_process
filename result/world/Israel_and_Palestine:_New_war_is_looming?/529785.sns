Cease-fire brings peace to Gaza, expected to hold for long

Shattered showcases, broken laptops and scattered CDs -- that's what came to Ahmed Zaqout's sight when he walked into his computer shop one day after the Hamas-Israeli cease-fire took effect in Gaza.Like many Palestinians in the coastal enclave, Zaqout, 32, could finally come out of his home and check his workplace after eight days of heavy aerial bombardment by Israel.On Wednesday, Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip reached a cease-fire agreement brokered by Egypt after the conflict had claimed the lives of 164 Gazans."My losses here are nothing compared to those who have lost their families," he said. "In two days, we will restart the business... This is Gaza where life doesn't end."The cease-fire brings life in Gaza back to normal -- shops and restaurants opened and the streets, once occupied by ambulances and firefighter vehicles, are now full of people celebrating the cease-fire.The Israeli airstrikes killed 164 Palestinians, including 43 children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, 6 were killed by rockets fired from Gaza.Just across Omar al-Mukhtar Street where Zaqout's store is located, a compound housing civilian offices of Hamas government was erased by Israeli F16 airplanes' six bombs.Ahmed Tal'at, 40, stared at the rubble and said "that's a civilian place... we used to go there for IDs and birth certificates." He believed that Hamas will be able to resume the offices' work though most of the premises have been damaged.In Gaza City, people are busy cleaning the roads filled with rubble and fixing wires that were cut during the Israeli offensive.The end of the Israeli operation also brought a scene that has been absent for years. For the first time since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, supporters of rival Fatah movement headed by Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, took to the streets to celebrate the cease-fire.Supporters of the two rivals gathered at the yard of the Palestinian Legislative Council, where Fatah's yellow flags that had been mostly banned by Hamas fluttered alongside the green ones of Hamas."We should unite in one bunker and in one leadership," said Khalil Al-Hayya of Hamas while Nabil Shaath, a Fatah member, said "we should go out from this yard to the yard of unity."However, hopes for unity remain slim. In the afternoon, a Hamas spokesman denied reports that Hamas was supporting Abbas' bid to upgrade the status of the Palestinians in the UN.Gaza ceasefire expected to hold for longEight days of fighting between Hamas and Israel ended on Wednesday evening with the announcement that a ceasefire had been reached and came into effect at 21:00 local time.The announcement was made in Cairo by United States Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, the two main mediators of the agreement.On the Israeli side, it agreed to stop its military actions on air, land and sea, including targeted killings. The Palestinians, on their part, will stop launching rockets towards Israeli territory as well as attacks against soldiers across the border.It has been reported that Israel will let people and goods pass more freely at the passages on the Gaza Strip border. The directives about the blockade on the Gaza Strip will be determined in the upcoming days, according to reports."The ceasefire agreement will hold and it's in everybody's interest. In that sense, it's a success for both sides," Professor Gabriel Ben-Dor of the University of Haifa told Xinhua on Thursday."For Israel it will buy security for the people in the south and it will buy Israel time to get adjusted to the new situation in the south, and time to develop new technology to combat the rocket fire," he said."From Hamas' point of view they have gained more legitimacy, they gained an international standing and they gained more support at home from the people to whom they can sell this war as something of a success," Ben-Dor added.Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2005 by ousting forces loyal to Fatah, the organization has slowly moved towards statehood with its own government and ministries. And in the long run this can be a positive development for Israel, because it means that Hamas is becoming part of the international community with the various obligations involves.While the Hamas government doesn't need to fear that it will be ousted in the next elections, as none are held, it still needs to listen to people of the coastal enclave and explain its actions, especially if those action results in an Israel military counteraction.Eitan Shamir of the Bar-Ilan University argued the decision makers in Israel are employing the same logic towards Gaza as they did towards Hezbollah in the second Lebanon war in 2006; in which Israel fought a month long war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon after two Israeli soldiers were kidnapped by Hezbollah.In addition to air and naval strikes on Lebanon, Israel also sent ground forces into Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by firing rocks over northern Israel."The basic logic is creating a situation where you hit the other side whether it's Hamas or Hezbollah, you hit it very hard and following that you acquire a period of quiet," Shamir said."So in the end, the assumption is that these organizations have to do some cost-benefit calculations and they will realize that it 's better for them, in their own interest, to remain quiet because the cost is to high," he added.While this is the same tactic which Israel used during Operation Cast Lead in 2009, which had the same objective as the now completed Operation Pillar of Defense, the major difference is how the conflict ended in 2009 and this time around, in which there is a ceasefire agreement brokered by a third party.In 2006 the ceasefire agreement was mediated by the United Nations, and since then the Israeli-Lebanese border has been quiet. So the fact that there is a ceasefire agreement now and the fighting didn't end with a unilateral Israeli ceasefire and then Hamas following suite, as was the case in 2009, should be taken as a sign that this time the Israel-Gaza border will also be quiet.Another difference from Cast Lead is the involvement of Egypt, while in 2009 the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak kept Egypt on the sidelines, his successor Mohammed Morsi quickly took the role of mediator.While Morsi's party, the Muslim Brotherhood, does enjoy strong ties with Hamas, it also has relations with Israel and the U.S. which make it an ideal candidate for the role as a peace keeper.
