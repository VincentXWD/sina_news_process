Fishing flourishes after Israel eases blockade on Gaza

GAZA, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Several fishermen were removing green sea algae stuck on their fishing boats that have been docking at Gaza fishing harbor for years due to an Israeli blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip sea.Right after Islamic Hamas movement has violently seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel imposed a tight ground and sea blockade on the coastal enclave. The blockade prevented fishermen from fishing for more than five years, as the Israeli naval ships always chased their boats.The eight-day large-scale mutual attacks between Israel and Hamas ended Wednesday following an Egypt-brokered ceasefire deal, under which Israel decided to enlarge the allowed zone for fishing from three to six miles.A fisherman named Rezeq al-Quqa, who got assistance from his son, were cleaning his boat and had managed to turn its engine on."We want to sail into the sea quickly ... There are three miles more and certainly there are lots of fish," said al-Quqa, who is one of the some 370 fishermen in Gaza who were providing fish to 1. 7 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Since the blockade was imposed on the coastal enclave, the fish catch dropped 70 percent and the local people have to buy fish from Egypt.Jamal Basala, a 61-year-old fisherman from Gaza, has been secretly sailing from Gaza to Egyptian shores for fishing. He told Xinhua that "We hope the fishermen in Gaza can go fishing freely and expand the fishing zone from six miles to 12 miles as it used to be before 2007."Mohamed Basala, son of Jamal, told Xinhua with a wide smile that "We spent the whole night sailing and fishing in the sight of the Israeli navy and no one prevented us from fishing."Basala and three of his children just came back on Monday from their first fishing sail in Gaza. They said they had managed this time to catch 30 kg of fish, adding that "The quality of fish increased and we are catching more fish than before."Before the ceasefire on Wednesday, prices of fish here were too high for many Gazans to afford. For instance, one kg of Seapass ( Luqos) fish was sold at 30 U.S. dollars, and now it is only 13 dollars.A small fish market in Gaza City's downtown was crowded on Monday with residents who came to buy fish. Market stalls were all full of various fish, shrimps, calamaries, craps, etc. Over the past five years, the market has been almost empty of customers."I already sold around 100 kg of fish today," said Omer Baker, a fish vendor, as he was busy cleaning the fish for the customers, adding that "Thanks to the armed resistance which managed to reach a ceasefire with Israel and ease the siege that destroyed our life. "According to Oslo accords signed in 1993 between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel was allowing fishermen to go deep for 12 miles into the sea for fishing, and it limited the allowed fishing zone to three miles after Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip. Several fishermen have been either killed, wounded or detained since the year 2000.After the eight-day violence between Israel and Hamas this month, during which 168 Palestinians and six Israeli were killed and more than 1,200 wounded, the Palestinians are expressing hope that Israel will completely lift the blockade and permanently open the crossing points.
