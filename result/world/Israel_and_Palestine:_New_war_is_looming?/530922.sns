David Sling constitutes breakthrough in Israel's air defense

JERUSALEM, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- A leading Israeli missile defense expert said Monday that the recent trial of a system being developed constituted a breakthrough in Israel's race to build a shield against growing threats of rocket and missile attacks.David's Sling, designed to intercept short and mid-range projectiles, successfully shot down an advanced missile in a first live-fire trial, the Israeli Defense Ministry revealed Sunday evening.A "perfect interception" was achieved during the trial held last Thursday in Israel's Negev desert, said a senior official in the ministry's Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure.Representatives of the American Missile Defense Agency, which is underwriting most of the system's development, attended the trial."It was the first in which all of the system's components worked in tandem to intercept a live missile. It was a significant milestone from which it's possible to begin the countdown to operational deployment," Uzi Rubin, the founder and first director of the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), told Xinhua on Monday.Speaking at an aerospace conference, in Jerusalem in November 2010, Rubin estimated that Israeli cities might be hit by more than 13,000 missiles and rockets in a future war waged on multiple fronts.AN ATOM IN A HAYSTACKRafael Advanced Defense Systems, one of Israel's largest defense contractors, and the U.S. missile giant Raytheon are jointly developing David's Sling, also known as Magic Wand, which can knock down projectiles at ranges of 70 to 250 km.The system's intercepting missile, dubbed Stunner, contains no explosive material. Instead, its dolphin-shaped tip is laden with state-of-the-art sensors that precisely guide it to an incoming projectile until impact, a method known as "hit-to-kill" or "iron- to-iron.""It's shot to the big skies, where it has to home in and directly strike its target, and you can't miss by a single inch," Rubin said. "It's not finding a needle in a haystack. Here, it's about finding an atom in a haystack."David's Sling is scheduled to become operational in 2014. Once in service, it will comprise the middle tier of Israel's multi- tier active air defense (MTAD), an ambitious project that purports to provide a comprehensive shield against a multitude of threats - from crude short-range rockets favored by Gaza militants to highly- accurate Iranian ballistic missiles that can strike anywhere in Israel.MTAD went into high gear in the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon war, when some 4,000 Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese militia Hezbollah slammed into northern Israel, and as rocket attacks from Gaza continued unabated.Its top tier is Arrow II, a system designed to intercept conventional and nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles high in the stratosphere; Arrow III, still being developed, is slated to become operational in 2015-2016.To date, the lowest tier, Iron Dome, which intercepts short- range projectiles, has given the bang for the buck, shooting down upwards of 350 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel last week in the worst cross-border fighting in years.AN ASSORTMENT OF TARGETSWhile Iron Dome is currently the only system to had seen real action, Thursday's trial, which was held amid intense rocket barrages, prompted defense officials here to voice confidence that David's Sling would perform brilliantly in due time.The system's all-weather multi-mission (MMR) radar, similar to the upgraded model already in use on Iron Dome, is capable of locking on several targets simultaneously and provides enlarged coverage. Analysts on Monday said that 3 to 4 batteries would be sufficient to defend Israel.Especially its northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah stocks tens of thousands of rockets with a range that falls within that of David's Sling, including 220mm Katyushas and Iranian-made heavy artillery rockets, such as the Zelzal, Khaibar, Fateh-110 and the M600, a high-precision, GPS-guided rocket that can carry a 600 kg warhead.The timing of Sunday's disclosure of the live-fire trial was not coincidental. Earlier in the day, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said his organization would fire rockets that can reach anywhere in Israel in a future war."The last campaign from Gaza was waged with missiles that reached 40 to 80 km." Nasrallah said in a pre-recorded speech in honor of the Day of Ashura commemorated by Shi'a Muslims."I say that the next campaign against us will include all of occupied Palestine, from the Lebanese border to the Red Sea, from Kiryat Shmona to Eilat."The Israel Air Force, however, is reportedly seeking to expand David's Sling missions beyond Nasrallah's rockets. The system may possibly prove handy in intercepting additional threats, such as enemy aircraft, unmanned drones and even low-flying cruise missiles, local media said.As another layer of defense, analysts said, David's Sling is an integral component in Israel's aspiration to reduce to zero the chance of a nuclear-tipped missile penetrating its air defenses.But professionals, both military and civilian, are careful to emphasize that no system, as advanced as it may be, can provide hermetic protection. David's Sling and its counterparts, they say, are not meant to replace the military's attack and deterrence capabilities but rather supplement them."Human beings can't do a perfect job, only God," said Rubin, noting that Arrow, which became operational in 2000, was originally developed to intercept Syrian Scuds with a chemical warhead."It's possible to reach an interception rate of more than 90 percent, but that does not give you total protection. David's Sling is intended to deal with growing conventional threats," he said.
