China opposes Israeli settlement expansion: FM spokesmanChina on Monday reiterated its opposition to Israel's settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, urging Israel to create necessary conditions to resume the peace talks with Palestine at an early date."China has always firmly opposed Israel's construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory of East Jerusalem and the West Bank," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily news briefing.Israel's security cabinet led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to permit the construction of 3,000 more housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, apparently in retaliation for Palestine's successful statehood bid at the UN, Israeli media reported on Friday."We urge the Israeli side to take substantial steps to eliminate obstacles to the peace talks with Palestine and create necessary conditions to rebuild mutual trust and relaunch the peace talks at an early date," Hong said.Israel's move came less than 24 hours after Palestine won a vote at the UN General Assembly to upgrade its status at the world body from an observer entity to a non-member observer state.The peace process between Israel and Palestine came to a halt in 2010 over growing criticism of Israel's expansion of its West Bank settlements.U.S. urges Israel to reconsider settlement plan The United States on Monday urged Israel to reconsider its newly announced settlement plan as its key ally has drawn widespread condemnation over the unilateral move."We urge Israeli leaders to reconsider these unilateral decisions and exercise restraint as these actions are counterproductive and make it harder to resume direct negotiations to achieve a two-state solution," White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a regular news briefing."We oppose all unilateral actions, including settlement activity and housing construction as they complicate efforts to resume direct, bilateral negotiations and risk prejudging the outcome of those negotiations and this including building in the so-called E-1 area," he said.Israel okayed last Friday the construction of 3,000 more housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and decided to further the planning procedures of another 1,000 units in settlements, including the section connecting between Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, the so-called E-1 area.The move came one day after the Palestinians won an elevated status of observer state through the UN General Assembly despite vehement opposition from the U.S. and Israel."We have made clear to the Israeli government that such action is contrary to U.S. policy, opposing unilateral action, including settlement activity and housing construction in East Jerusalem and we in the international community expect all parties to play a constructive role in efforts to achieve peace," Carney said.U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner also repeated opposition to the Israeli move."The United States opposes all unilateral actions, including West Bank settlement activity and housing construction in East Jerusalem, as they complicate efforts to resume direct, bilateral negotiations, and risk prejudging the outcome of those negotiations," Toner said in a statement."This includes building in the E-1 area as this area is particularly sensitive and construction there would be especially damaging to efforts to achieve a two-state solution," he added. " We urge the parties to cease unilateral actions and take concrete steps to return to direct negotiations so all the issues can be discussed and the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security can be realized."Washington has recommitted itself to bringing the parties back to the negotiating table, stressing direct talks as the only means to achieve a two-state solution.Israel's settlement building on the occupied land has been long rejected by the majority of the international community, and the issue scuttled the last direct talks with the Palestinians only weeks after they were initiated in Washington in early September 2010.Russia urges Israel to reconsider settlement expansionMoscow is seriously concerned with Israel's plans to build 3,000 residential units on the occupied Palestinian territories as well as to withhold money transfers to Palestine's coffer, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday.Israel revealed last week its plans to construct another 3,000 houses in Eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank.On Sunday, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said he would not transfer the tax payments that Israel collected on behalf of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)."Moscow is very seriously concerned with these intentions of Israel. Building the settlements on the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967 is illegal. Russia and international community as a whole does not recognize it," Russian Foreign Ministry said in an online comment.Israel's announcements came shortly after the UN General Assembly voted for upgrading the status of Palestine to a non-member observer state last week."Implementation of the new large-scale plans of settlement activity would negatively affect the efforts to resume direct talks about two-state solution of the Palestine-Israel conflict," said the ministry.Russia added that withholding of the financial transfers would lead to a ballooning PNA budget deficit and will aggravate already uneasy social, economic, humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories."We urge Israeli side to reconsider the plans of settlements building and to resume money transfers to the Palestinians, thus keeping open a possibility of resumption of peace talks and reaching just and stable peace in the region," said the statement.Palestinian share of the Israeli-collected tax revenues make up one third of PNA's budget.France summons Israeli ambassador over settlement expansionFrance on Monday summoned the Israeli ambassador to protest Israel's newly proposed settlement plans, French Foreign Ministry said in a statement."The Israeli ambassador was reminded that France condemns Israeli settlement activity in all its forms," the statement said."Settlement activity is illegal under international law, undermines the trust necessary for the resumption of dialogue and constitutes an obstacle to a just peace based on the two-state solution," it added.On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to construct 3,000 new settlements mainly in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. The move came a day after the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to recognize Palestine as a non-member observer state.France was the first European state to confirm it would vote for upgrading the Palestinians' status at the UN from "entity" to "non-member state."In the statement, the French Foreign Ministry warned Israel that "construction in the E1 area would seriously undermine the two-state solution by isolating Jerusalem, which is destined to become the capital of both states, from the West Bank, and by threatening the territorial contiguity and viability of the future Palestinian state.""We urge the parties to the peace process to refrain from any gesture that might complicate the swift and unconditional resumption of the negotiations, which we've been calling for," the ministry stressed.On Saturday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius urged Israeli officials to "clearly demonstrate their willingness to resume (peace) negotiations.""This decision would be a serious obstacle to the solution of two states, by undermining the territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian state. It would undermine the trust necessary for the resumption of dialogue," the minister said.The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians came to a halt in 2010 over growing criticism of Israel's expansion of its West Bank settlements.UN chief admonishes IsraelUnited Nations chief Ban Ki-Moon is calling on Israel to cancel plans for the building of new settlements in occupied Palestinian territories which he says doom any solution for peace in the Middle East to failure.Last week the Israeli authorities approved the construction of three thousand housing units in Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.This occurred after the recognition of the Palestinian state in the UN as an observer nation.On Sunday, the Israeli government unanimously rejected the decision of the General Assembly for recognition of Palestinian statehood and promised to defend Israeli “rights” to the disputed territory.
