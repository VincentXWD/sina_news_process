Israel to agree large-scale construction in East JerusalemThe Israeli authorities have started the process of coordination of the planned large-scale construction in northern Jerusalem.The Interior Ministry has granted authorization to start construction in the Rama-Shlomo quarter. The building of 1,500 flats could get under way there as early as next year.Projects to build 6,500 housing units, including in the quarters of Givat-Khamatos and Gilo, are due to be agreed by later this week.According to the Jerusalem city council, the plans to that end were drawn up several years ago, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave them the green light after Palestinians had unilaterally asked the United Nations for their non-member state status. Israel’s fresh construction stage has already drawn an angry reaction from the Palestinian Administration.The Palestinian Administration President, Mahmoud Abbas, has instructed his representative at the United Nations to file a protest.Palestine seeks UNSC assistance against IsraelThe Palestinian leadership is seeking measures from the UN Security Council to end the Israeli construction of settlements on its territory.Earlier in the Israeli Ministry of the Interior reported that the agency plans to issue a permit for the construction of 1,500 housing units in East Jerusalem.On November 30th the UN General Assembly elevated the status of the Palestinian Authority to that of an observer nation which allows it to seek the assistance of the UN and the International Criminal Court against the actions of Israel.Palestinian MP urges boycott of Israeli goodsPalestinian Prime Minister Salaam Fayyad has called on his people to boycott Israeli products in protest against Tel Aviv’s decision to withhold funds to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority.Mr. Fayad also reminded the Arab countries of their failure to live up to their promise to allocate a monthly $100 million to the Palestinians, and called for an emergency Arab summit to discuss the financial crisis the PA is going through.Earlier this month, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz decided to confiscate the tax revenues that Israel collected for the Palestinian Authority during the month of November, and use it to offset the PA's debt to Israel's Electric Corporation.The move comes in response to the upgrade of Palestine at the United Nations to non-member observer state.
