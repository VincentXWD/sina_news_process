A concrete step in eurozone economic governance

by Chong Dahai, Zhang ZhengfuBRUSSELS, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) --- Though the adoption of a set of new rules by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) of European Union (EU) on Tuesday may be submerged by the escalations of political crisis in Greece and Italy, it was a concrete step in enhancing eurozone's economic governance in the long run.LONG-AWAITED RESOLUTIONSThe six legislative proposals on economic governance, or the Six-Pack, refers to a package of six directives and regulations on budget deficits, spending levels, and tax levels, among others, aimed at safeguarding financial stability in the eurozone and in the EU by exerting preventive and effective surveillance.The resolutions would give European Commission and Council of European Union more power on supervising and influencing Member States' budgetary situation and in a wider sense, general economic situation and preventing imbalance from happening. It would make the violation of the Pact more expensive, thus achieving the goal of better discipline in fiscal policy."I expect the so-called 'six-pack' to enter into force by mid-December and, mark my words: I intend to fully implement the new rules from Day One," said Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner of the EU, at a press conference after a meeting with the EU's finance ministers.It has been long that EU sets some guidelines for Member States budgetary policies, for example the "Stability and Growth Pact" which came into force in 1997."We've seen many concrete things, we see EFSF, we see 'Euro semester', we see 'Euro Plus Pact', 'Six-Pack' and 'Growth And Stability Pack'. Those are steps towards closer coordination and stronger governance," said Janis A. Emmanouilidis, senior policy analyst with European Policy Center (EPC), a well known European think-tank.However the problem is that these policies were not strictly followed, and thereby laid seeds of debt crisis and financial turmoil of the day.ECONOMIC GOVERNMENT LOOMS AHEADThe resolution also illustrates direction of eurozone structural reform. Entities at EU level are given more power on deciding Member States' policies, a prototype of "economic government" at EU level is looming ahead.The idea of "economic government" is advocated by many researchers. Pau De Grauwe, Associate Senior Research Fellow with Center of European Policy Studies (CEPS), a Brussels-based think-tank, who is also an advisor to the European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, believed that some kinds of economic government will be necessary to deal with current crisis."Coordination and surveillance are not enough to deal with current crisis; there must be some kinds of entity governing European economic policies. Otherwise, the risk of breaking-up of euro is still there." Pau De Grauwe, an Associate Senior Research Fellow with Center of European Policy Studies (CEPS), a Brussels-based think-tank said.RACE WITH TIMEThe resolution, however, seems to have come late. Crisis in Greece runs almost beyond control and situation in Italy worsens recently. It seems EU will deal with Italy and Greece as first priority.What's more, EU's typical slow reaction to situation may make things worse, as it takes more than a year for the "six-pack" to come into force. It also took about three months for the resolution of July 21 summit to clear all Member States of eurozone. What the Europe need is quick reaction and quick action.Among the "must-do" list of the eurozone is to put out fire in Italy, as it is "too big to fall." Then the EFSF must satisfy huge demand for bailout funds in 2012, may be over 400 billion euro, as some analysts point out. ECOFIN is discussing ways of leveraging EFSF, and the results, which may come out in December, remain to be seen.Another hurdle to overcome is treaty change, which no longer stands as a taboo. This will be done in a long run, but must be quicker than the development of crisis.
