LISBON, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- Portugal is not in need of any additional financial assistance, Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker said here on Wednesday."I don't believe that Portugal will need higher amounts (of capital)," Juncker told a press conference after a meeting with Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.According to Juncker, the international bailout program designed for the Portuguese economy "might need some technical adjustments," but not a complete change.The Eurogroup chief said he believed Portugal was doing everything so that the goals of the bailout program could be achieved.In a conference on economic governance in the EU later on Wednesday, Juncker said he did not believe the current escalating eurozone debt crisis was a crisis of the euro currency."The truth is that, against the general conception that is established throughout Europe, the euro currency is not in crisis. I get furious when I hear someone saying the the euro is in a crisis. We are facing a debt crisis in some countries," he said.
