MONTEVIDEO, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- Europe has enough resources to overcome its debt crisis without becoming a financial burden to the emerging economies, a UN official said Wednesday.Europe lacks "leadership" and a capacity to implement "the logic of resolving the crisis with a collective view," Alicia Barcena, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), told local press during a meeting of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) in the Uruguayan capital.She said Europe can't ask China, Brazil or Russia to finance its debt problem when Europe has the resources to solve it.Moreover, Barcena said Latin America will suffer from the global economic slowdown and will register an average growth of 4.4 percent in 2011.Earlier, Barcena met with ALADI's Secretary-General Carlos Alvarez and agreed with him to work out an agenda to expand regional trade in Latin America.Alvarez and Barcena also agreed to appeal for a joint effort "to compare the different models of regional integration, including Europe,Asia-Pacific and Latin America."
