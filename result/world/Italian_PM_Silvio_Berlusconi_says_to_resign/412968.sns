Will Italy seek bailout?

by Yoo SeungkiSEOUL, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Fears spread that Italy may seek international bailout after borrowing costs of the world's No. 8 economy soared to a dangerous level Wednesday.According to the Korea Center for International Finance (KCIF), the yield on the Italy's 10-year government bonds soared 49 basis points (bps) to a euro-era record of 7.21 percent, breaching the dangerous threshold of 7 percent at which Greece, Ireland and Portugal sought bailout funds.The three peripheral nations were all forced to ask for bailout funds after their borrowing costs reached similar levels. Greece sought international bailout just 17 days after its borrowing costs breached the 7 percent level, while Ireland and Portugal took 22 days and 91 days each in seeking bailouts after their yields breached that level."It is imperative for Italy to seek international bailout. Greece, Ireland and Portugal asked for financial aid within three months after their borrowing costs breached the 7 percent level," Kang Hyun-gie, a strategist at Solomon Investment & Securities in Seoul, told Xinhua.Kang, however, noted that the Italian event would unlikely cause a Greek-typed turmoil in the global financial market as the euro region's third-largest economy could avert the crisis through its own capacity such as strong manufacturing sector and international trade.HEAVY DEBTAccording to the Italian central bank's data, Italy's aggregate debts amounted to 1.89 trillion euros (2.56 trillion U.S. dollars), exceeding that of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland combined. The rate of Italy's debts to its gross domestic product (GDP) reached 118 percent last year, the second-highest in the euro zone after Greece.Italy had a sea of debts to refinance next year, with debts that mature in February to April accounting for 45 percent of the total maturing in 2012. Even though Italy could afford to refinance 37.3 billion euros in debts that mature within this year, the economy would face challenges next year without outside help."Italy is the third-largest economy in euro area, accounting for 17 percent of the region's total GDP. Italy is also a huge government bond market, which can trigger troubles in other nations with exposure to its debts," said Lee Young-won, a strategist at HMC Investment & Securities in Seoul.Lee noted the possibility could not be ruled out that Europe's debt crisis would fall into another serious phase like the Greek crisis if Italy may get bailout funds, and consequently other nations with Italian exposure should realize losses on their books.According to Bank for International Settlement (BIS), France was exposed to Italian debts worth 289.8 billion euros as of the end of March, with German exposure amounting to 116.5 billion euros. Spain had relatively small exposure to Italy worth 25.3 billion euros.TO BIG TO SAVEGiven Italy's position and scale of economy in the region, European leaders were expected to give a helping hand to Italy, but they are faced with dilemmas that Europe has not enough resources to save such a big country."Italy is a too-big-to-fail economy, which Europe cannot give up, but the euro area's current rescue fund will not stabilize market fears. European leaders should unveil determined measures such as printing money by the European Central Bank (ECB) or issuing Euro Bonds, but those actions would not be taken in the short term," said Lee Eun-taek, a strategist at Dongbu Securities in Seoul.Under the current 440 billion euros European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Italy could receive a financial support of around 160 billion euros, or 10 percent of its GDP, but it was not enough to save the nation, of which haircut was estimated to rise up to 20 percent. European leaders agreed to boost the EFSF to 1 trillion euros, but the agreement was not fleshed out yet.The Group of 20 (G20) leaders discussed whether to boost the IMF's funds in a bid to assist troubled nations in Europe, but concrete plan was not decided. The ECB, now helmed by a former Italian central bank governor Mario Draghi, implemented bond- buying program to ease Italy's strains, but objections to the bond purchases have been growing recently.VICIOUS CYCLEMarket watchers worried that the global financial market may slip into a vicious cycle as seen in Greece's case. Following the Greek bond yield breaching the 7 percent level in July last year, the yield soared to 12 percent level in one month, and the nation faced additional troubles such as credit rating downgrades, political split and civil protests against austerity plans."The market is increasingly worried about a vicious cycle of higher yields resulting in the imposition of higher collateral haircuts on Italian government bonds and faster rating downgrades, as happened to other periphery issuers as their funding costs rose, " said Luca Jellinek, head of European rates Strategy in Credit Agricole.LCH Clearnet, a Europe-based clearing house, triggered such a vicious cycle. The clearing house lifted the deposit it demands for Italian bonds that mature in seven and 10 years to 11.65 percent overnight from the previous 6.65 percent. That means institutional investors should pay additional costs when they trade repurchase agreements (RPs) with Italian bonds as collateral."Italy was directly hit by LCH Clearnet's action. In addition, French and German banks have reduced their exposure to Italy over the past four months," said Kang Hyun-cheol, a strategist at Woori Investment & Securities in Seoul.Jellinek predicted that the market would remain skeptical and skittish until sufficient reforms are undertaken and the ECB and German bloc decide to monetize debt on a much larger scale.
