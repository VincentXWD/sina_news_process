Massive public cut only way for Italy to exit debt crisis: expert

By Marzia De GiuliMILAN, Italy, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Massive cut of public expenses is the only solution to Italy's turmoil driven by investors' fears that the country could become the next victim of the debt crisis, a well-known Italian historian told Xinhua in a recent interview.Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's announcement of resignation once the budget law is approved did not reassure at all international markets, Ernesto Galli della Loggia, a Modern History professor at Firenze-based Italian Institute of Human Sciences (SUM) noted.The approval of budget measures in the next few days will be likely followed by a technocrat government, which the expert saw as the most likely solution although "difficult times are still expected to come before Italy can move concrete steps out of the dramatic present situation."The crucial question, Galli della Loggia pointed out, is not passing the strict measures requested by the EU but implementing the policies.No government in Italy had enough courage in the past decades to cut the "exorbitant expenses that led the country to be crippled by its public debt at the point that it has stopped growing since ten years ago," Galli della Loggia said.According to recent data of the Italian Central Bank, Italy's aggregate debts amounted to 1.89 trillion euro (2.56 trillion U.S. dollars), exceeding that of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland combined, while Italy's 118 debt-to-GDP ratio is the second-highest in the eurozone.Neither European partners nor the abundant private savings of the Italians would be able to avoid the Mediterranean country's default in case the international distrust reaches an irreversible point, the expert stressed."In this situation, Italy is in urgent need of dramatically severe reforms in crucial fields such as education, health care, legal and working systems, starting from the consideration that the country has maintained for 30 years life standards not admissible anymore," he said."For example, public universities should ask an adequate yearly fee, at the same time assuring a rational use of scholarships, while a reform of the pension system would stop many Italians from retiring at the early age of 50-55 years," Galli della Loggia said.A radical change would also be necessary in the health care system, "that in Italy is managed by local governments often inefficient and corrupted, which creates an incredible amount of waste and squandering," he added.Fighting widespread tax evasion through severe punishments, firing inefficient public employees and promoting meritocracy in the working world would also significantly contribute to expenses cut, Galli della Loggia highlighted.However in his view, "the majority of Italians do not have a perception of the real drama." The country will not be able to implement these necessary structural reforms only when it will become aware of the concrete risk of an economic catastrophe, he said.
