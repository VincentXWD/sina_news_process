Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconihas pledged to resign after the Italian Parliament passes austerity measures. The measures could pass before the month is out, and will soon draw to a close his third non-consecutive term as the country’s premier.Berlusconi has been a central figure in Italian politics since he was first elected prime minister in 1994, but he has been a billionaire and a well-known businessman long before he ever ran for office and is still one of the richest people in the world today, despite the controversy he engenders. He first appeared on Forbes’ billionaires list in 1988, the second time Forbes ever published such a list. He has not missed a year since.Berlusconi got his start singing on cruise ships but entered the business world in construction in the 1960s. In the 1970s he broke into television by buying up local stations around Italy and forming a national network.Through his holding company, Fininvest, he controls Mediaset, Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster. His most valuable holding, it has taken a beating along with Berlusconi’s reputation. Its shares have steadily lost value since their peak more than five years ago. They dropped more than 60% in the past year and have fallen further since its key holder announced his resignation.His other big stake, in life insurance and banking outfit Mediolanum, has also fallen recently, helping push Berlusconi’s personal fortune down from $7.8 billion in March to an estimated $6 billion in recent days. He is worth less than half of what he was in 2000, when his fortune peaked at $12.8 billion. Berlusconi, who was elected Prime Minister for a second time a year later, has never gotten back to that height.Now he’ll have free time to refocus on business and try to boost his fortune. But don’t count on it. He leaves Italy a mess and, besides, has a knack for getting into trouble. Over the years, he has been accused of everything from bribery, false accounting, collusion, tax evasion, and embezzlement. Three trials are currently pending for tax fraud, corruption, and paying for sex with a minor. In 2009, Berlusconi’s wife of 19 years left after accusing him of cavorting with young womenBelow, see a graph of Berlusconi’s net worth, since he became a billionaire for the first time in 1988.(Agencies)
