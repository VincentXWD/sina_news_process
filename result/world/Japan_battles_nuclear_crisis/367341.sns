Japan nuclear plant plugs highly radioactive leak

TOKYO – Workers at Japan's tsunami-damaged nuclear power plant on Wednesday finally stemmed a tide of radiation that was pouring into the Pacific and exacerbating concerns over the safety of seafood.High levels of contamination have been measured at the shoreline of the Fukushima Dai-ichi complex in recent days, prompting the government to set limits for the first time on the amount of radiation permitted in fish.While officials have said the crack in a maintenance pit plugged early Wednesday was the only one found, they have not explicitly ruled out that radioactive water is leaking into the sea from another point.Authorities insisted the radioactive water would dissipate and posed no immediate threat to sea creatures or people who might eat them. Most experts agreed.Still, Japanese officials adopted the new standards as a precaution. And the mere suggestion that seafood from the country that gave the world sushi could be at any risk stirred worries throughout the fishing industry."Even if the government says the fish is safe, people won't want to buy seafood from Fukushima," says Ichiro Yamagata, a fisherman who lived in the shadow of the power plant. "We probably can't fish there for several years."Fukushima is not a major fishing region, and no fishing is allowed in the direct vicinity of the plant. But experts estimate the coastal areas hit by the massive wave last month account for about a fifth of Japan's annual catch.Radiation concerns in the area intensified after the discovery over the weekend of the crack, which photos showed water pouring out of and splashing into the sea.Since then, workers have raced to find a way to seal it, pouring in concrete and injecting a mixture of polymer, sawdust and shredded newspaper. Both failed.But on Wednesday morning, Tokyo Electric Power Co. spokesman Naoki Tsunoda said the injection of 400 gallons (1,500 liters) of "water glass," or sodium silicate, and another agent near a seaside pit appeared to be successful.It was a rare bit of good news for the utility that owns the crippled nuclear plant, located about 140 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo. But highly contaminated water continues to pool around the complex. Tsunoda said officials were investigating whether the contaminated water is leaking from other places.The new limits on radioactivity in fish were imposed after TEPCO announced water tested near the plant Saturday contained levels of radioactive iodine 7.5 million times the legal limit. That level had dropped to 5 million two days later.Japan said some fish caught last week about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the plant would have exceeded the new safety limits, which may change as circumstances do.Fears of radiation contamination prompted India to announce Tuesday that it was halting food imports from Japan. Few countries have gone so far, but India's three-month ban reflected the unease created by the nuclear crisis among consumers. India said the ban would last three months or until the risk subsides. It planned to review the situation weekly.Yamagata, whose home is within the 12-mile (20-kilometer) evacuation zone around the plant, is staying in a Tokyo soccer stadium with his wife and about 140 other refugees. He expects his fishing days are over.　[1]　[2]　[Next]
