SEOUL, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean and Japanese experts will meet later this week in Tokyo to discuss Japan's nuclear debacle, the first such meeting since the devastating earthquake and tsunami last month crippled nuclear reactors in Japan's northeastern province of Fukushima, local reports said Monday.The two-day meeting starting Tuesday will bring together six South Korean experts including those from the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety and their Japanese counterparts, who are expected to discuss threats of radiation leaks from the damaged reactors and check and monitor radiation levels.The meeting comes after South Korea expressed concern last week over neighboring Japan's release of water contaminated with low- level radiation into the sea without any prior warning, which sparked public criticism here for a lack of communication between the two neighbors.Depending on the outcome of the meeting, South Korea might consider dispatching a team of nuclear experts to Japan or conducting a joint research with Japan, according to local reports.
