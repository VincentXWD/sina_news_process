PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Electricity of France (EDF), Europe's leading electricity supplier, decided on Thursday to take an in-depth review of the design of its nuclear power stations as part of a comprehensive effort to intensify nuclear security after Japan's nuclear crisis.This review, to be carried out "between now and the end of 2011 ", will check "the safety margins for facilities dealing with the events following earthquakes, floods, power failures or interruptions to cooling processes," involving reactors and spent fuel pools, the partly-state-owned company said in a statement.The review will be done under the control of the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), said EDF.Other measures include assessment of the technical and human resources currently in place for accident situations at the highest level and the creation of a national EDF rapid reaction task force for potential crisis.Running 58 active nuclear reactors across France, the EDF group was requested by the French government to intensify safety measure in nuclear power production in the wake of the Japanese nuclear crisis triggered off by the March 11 earthquake and ensuing tsunami.Though EDF has hydraulic production facilities and wind power generators, nuclear stations provide over 70 percent of its electricity output.
