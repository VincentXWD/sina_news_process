Ukrainians lit candles to commemorate those who died after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, during a ceremony at the memorial to Chernobyl firefighters in the city of Slavutich, Ukraine, Tuesday, April 26, 2011. Ukraine marked the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which was the world's worst ever nuclear accident. Some 50,000 Pripyat residents were evacuated after the disaster, taking only a few belongings. They never returned, and workers and their families now live in the new town of Slavutich, 60 kilometers (37.5 miles) from the plant. The city of Slavutich was built following the evacuation of Pripyat, which was just 1.5 kilometers (about one mile) away from the Chernobyl plant.
