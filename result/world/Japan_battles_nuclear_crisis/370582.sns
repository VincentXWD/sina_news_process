UNITED NATIONS - Liechtenstein on Tuesday said that the effects of Chernobyl disaster must at last to some extent be compensated as the tragedy of such enormous proportions can never be erased from memories.Christian Wenaweser, the permanent representative of Liechtenstein to the UN, made the statement at a meeting of the UN General Assembly to mark the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.On April 26, 1986, the number four reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union exploded, causing the worst nuclear accident in history.The explosion killed 30 people on the spot, released more than eight tons of highly radioactive material, contaminated 60,000 square km of land, and caused more than 3.2 million people to be affected by radiation."The word Chernobyl will, in the minds of entire generations, forever be linked to the greatest nuclear disaster our world has yet experienced," he said. "We must reaffirm our determination to limit the effects of the disaster, and to prevent similar events in the future.""We continued to be concerned by the health problems affecting the lives of so many children, women and men. We are also aware of the environmental, economic and social consequences of the catastrophe," said Wenaweser.Solidarity has been forthcoming from the international community and an unprecedented effort on pollution mitigation and assessment of the real impact of the disaster has been made by many states, the ambassador noted, adding that the ultimate objective is to allow for sustainable development of the area around Chernobyl."The debates on the real impact of the disaster should prompt us to consolidate our efforts for the health of the people, for rehabilitation and for nuclear safety at the site," said Wenaweser.In terms of nuclear safety, Wenaweser emphasized the importance of the international commitments and the work on the new shelter for reactor number four at the site.
