BERLIN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday called for a worldwide stress test on nuclear reactors.Hours before taking off to France for the Group of Eight (G8) summit, Merkel told lawmakers in German parliament that she will push for nuclear security test and assessment "on an international level" in the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was still ongoing following a devastating earthquake in March."The security of nuclear energy usage cannot be safeguarded with nation decisions alone," she said. "Highest standards" of nuclear security should be implemented throughout the world.Merkel said Germany wants to accelerate its renewable energy research and production, in order to take a leading role in the green economy and to meet international climate change goals."We are going forward so that others can follow our example," she said.Later in the day, Merkel arrived at French coastal town of Deauville for the two-day G8 summit, in which the situation in northern Africa and some other Arab countries is set to top the agenda.
