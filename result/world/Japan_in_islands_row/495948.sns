A team of South Koreans on Monday began a 230-kilometer relay swim from an eastern port to the Dokdo islands, in Seoul’s latest assertion of its sovereignty over the outcrops claimed by Japan.The team led by singer Kim Jang-Hoon plans to complete the swim on Liberation Day Wednesday, which marks the ending in 1945 of Japan’s 35-year colonial rule over Korea.The territorial row over the Seoul-controlled islands, known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japan, has simmered for decades.It erupted again Friday when South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak visited the volcanic outcrops in the Sea of Japan (East Sea).An angry Japan recalled its ambassador from Seoul and Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the trip—the first by a South Korean president—was “extremely deplorable.”Kim jumped in the sea off Uljin in a full-body swimsuit after a ceremony with about 40 university students and dozens of others, Yonhap news agency reported.The students, all members of a swimming club at the Korea National Sport University, will take part in the 55-hour-long relay led by Kim, it said.The singer was set to celebrate his 45th birthday on the sea Tuesday.“I will never make such a comment as ‘Dokdo is our territory’ when I arrive there,” Kim told reporters before leaving. “It’s meaningless to do so because they are undeniably our territory.”(Agencies)
