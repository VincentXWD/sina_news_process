Russia will complete Kuril troopsâ€™ reinforcement by 2014 and the weapons of choice could be Bastion or BAL mobile coastal defense missile systems, Chief of the General Staff General Nikolay Makarov told the press on August 28.The reinforcement goes in accordance with the schedule earlier approved by the Russian President, and two modern garrisons will be built on the islands within years, the general added.As the weather is cold and snow on the islands can be up to 4 meters deep, Russia would not deploy tanks on the Kurils, and instead will build mobile coastal defense missile systems to match the security needs in that region.
