Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda may visit Russia by the end of this year, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday."We are going to work closely with the Japanese side to fill that visit with substance, so it would bring additional fruits to our cooperation," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich.Lukashevich added that both Moscow and Tokyo would work on making Noda's visit filled with a "particular content.""As far as I know, the (Russian) foreign minister plans to contact with (Japanese FM Koichiro) Gemba during the U.N. General Assembly. Perhaps, there we could understand more precisely the order of our joint actions and further political contacts," Lukashevich said.During the APEC economic leaders meeting in Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin said he has invited Noda to visit Russia.
