Among these funds, 120 million ruble was allocated to road project on Iturup, called Etorofu in Japan.The road connects Kurilsk , the administrative center of Kurilsky District, and a village 12 km from Kurilsk. The village is claimed by both Russia and Japan.“I hope the order could be carried out immediately, and the programme could be implemented completely. Russia will never forget people in remote regions,” said Medvedev.Russia and Japan have disputes over the Kuril Islands, which are called the Northern territories in Japan.The islands, comprising the islands of Kunashir, Shikotan, the Khabomai Rocks and Iturup, which were occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War II, are under Russian administration as South Kuril District of the Sakhalin Oblast. The territorial row has blocked a peace treaty between the two countries since the end of World War II.Dmitry Medvedev visited the island in his capacity as the Russian President in 2010.
