By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishChina Daily, a Beijing-based English-language newspaper of China, published a full two-page advertisement in two major U.S. newspapers on Friday, proclaiming the "Diaoyu Islands Belong to China".The ad, which included arguments for China's territorial claim, a photo of the islands and a map of the region, appeared in The Washington Post and The New York Times.The ad's headline asserts "Diaoyu Islands Belong to China" over a color picture of the string of islands in the East China Sea."Diaoyu Islands, which include Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands, have been an inherent territory of China since ancient times, and China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands," the advertisement said. "Japan's so-called 'nationalization' of Diaoyu Island severely infringes upon China's sovereignty."In the past few days, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and UN envoy Li Baodong have both taken the dispute with Japan to the international arena as world leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.Related news:Clinton to Japan: Respond "carefully" to ChinaJapan 'stole' our islands, foreign minister tells UN U.S. call for "cool heads" in China-Japan island disputeTo face up to past wrongdoings good to int'l ties: ROK  S.Korea: Japan must educate its people about wartime past  White paper on Diaoyu Islands hits the market  Bullet threat, Japan's yet another dirty trickStill, China's top political adviser meets peace-loving JapaneseSpecial Coverage:
