A group of South Korean lawmakers on Tuesday visited a group of islands at the heart of a territorial dispute with Japan -- a move likely to further stoke tensions with Tokyo.Seventeen members of the parliamentary National Defense Committee flew to the Dokdo islands (known as Takeshima in Japan) on military helicopters for a day-long visit, an aide to committee member Han Ki-Ho said.The trip -- labelled a government inspection session -- was aimed at checking security measures around the islands guarded by the South's coastguard, the aide said.Tokyo's chief cabinet secretary Osamu Fujimura said S. Korea lawmakers' landing on "very regrettable".Â
