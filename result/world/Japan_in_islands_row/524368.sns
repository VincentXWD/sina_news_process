Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's trip to Russia next month was put off due to Russian President Vladimir Putin's tight schedule, said local media.Kyodo reported that a government official said Tokyo received the message from Moscow, saying the planed visit in December would be difficult to fit in with Putin's schedule.And Putin has suffered serious back pain recently, added the official.The two countries may rearrange the schedule so that Noda could pay a visit to Russia in next January or later.The delayed visit was decided in September during a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vladivostok. Noda planed to talk with Putin over the Southern Kuril Islands (the four northern islands) issue.
