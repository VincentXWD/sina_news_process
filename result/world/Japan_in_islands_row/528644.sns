Sina English Four Chinese ships have again sailed into the waters off the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Japan's coastguard said that Chinese maritime surveillance vessels entered the 12-nautical-mile zone to the disputed islands shortly before 11 am on Tuesday.According to the Courier Mail, Chinese vessels have been spotted in and around the Diaoyu waters every day for the last month.Japanese coastguard reported they had warned the Chinese ships off the area, but their warnings were turned down by the Chinese vessels which remained patrolling in and around the disputed waters.Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reportedly lodged protest to the Chinese embassy in Tokyo.So far, there is no response from the Chinese side. But China would as always persist in its position that the Diaoyu Islands and their adjacent waters have been part of Chinese territory since ancient times, and China has also reiterated on many occasions that it will never yield to anything in terms of territorial sovereignty.Chinese vessels sail near Diaoyus for 31st dayFour Chinese surveillance vessels sailed into the waters off the Diaoyu Islands while four others left, according to Kyodo news reporting, citing the Japan Coast Guard.This is the 31th consecutive day that Chinese surveillance vessels patrol the Diaoyu Islands and the 3rd time vessels take shift.Once Japanese coast guard ships entered the Diaoyus waters, Chinese ships would “shout propaganda” in Chinese stating that the Diaoyus are Chinese territory.The coast guard said four Chinese maritime surveillance ships have been sailing around the islands since Nov. 7.“By now, China still maintains 4 vessels patrolling the Islands.” Kyodo news commented.
