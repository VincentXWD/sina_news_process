Japan's main opposition Liberal Democratic Party said Wednesday it would look at establishing a permanent presence on Diaoyu Islands.The main opposition party also promised a review of the self-imposed ban on defending allies, offering the possibility of Japanese troops returning fire if US forces come under attack.Promises to "examine" the issues were part of a series of policy pledges ahead of December 16 polls.The document, presented by LDP leader Shinzo Abe, offered a number of "reviews" and "studies", but stopped short of promises of action with binding goals.Opinion polls suggest the LDP could be the largest party after the election, putting Abe in line for a return to the premiership, but will need support from coalition partners to form a government.The document said the party "will clarify the rights of self-defence, including collective self-defence, and then will legislate basic law on national security".The LDP, which ruled Japan for an almost unbroken half century before it was ousted in 2009 by the Democratic Party of Japan, said it would "study the stationing of public servants to protect" Diaoyu Islands.Â
