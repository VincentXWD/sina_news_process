Japan's newly appointed ambassador to the United States Kenichiro Sasae said Tuesday China does not have any confidence or basis for the claim to the Diaoyu Islands, Japanese media reported.Sasae reportedly made the remarks at a press conference in Washington.Talking about the territorial row with China over the island chain in the East China Sea, Sasae brushed aside China's claim, saying, "if they are really confident about their territorial problem, I don't know why they are not going to the ICJ," referring to the International Court of Justice.  "I think they don't have any confidence or basis for their claims," he added.On the other hand, the new envoy stressed that Japan should not remain at odds with China."Japan and the U.S. need to cooperate to establish a relationship under which they can build future security and economic orders in the Asia-Pacific region together with China," he said.For that purpose, stable relations are needed among Japan, the U.S. and China, Sasae said.  Also on the agenda, Sasae said he will help promote the realignment of U.S. forces in Okinawa by ensuring close communication with Congress and the U.S. government while listening to views of the local governments and residents in Okinawa.Sasae, a former vice foreign minister, also noted that any global economic rules cannot be crafted without the participation of the U.S., China and Japan, the world's top three economies."If Japan sits back, Asia's economic order will be formed regardless of Japan," Sasae said, adding he hopes there will be more political support for the TPP negotiations.Â
