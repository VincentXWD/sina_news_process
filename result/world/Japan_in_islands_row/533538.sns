By Sina EnglishThe US Senate has unanimously approved an amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act that is designed to counter Chinaâ€™s sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands.To this, Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed serious concern and strong objection. The Ministry said the U.S. has vowed on many occasions that it would not take positions on Sino-Japanese territorial disputes, and hopefully the U.S. side would suit action to the word.Japan-US Security Treaty is a legacy of the Cold War, and should by no means go beyond the bilateral confines and harm the interests of a third party, the Foreign Ministry addedThe bill clearly states that the Diaoyu islands issue is covered by the fifth article of the Japan-US Security Treaty. Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat and one of the sponsors of the amendment says it stresses the importance of the US-Japan alliance, claiming it is a forceful strong signal towards supporting its important ally in the Asia Pacific.It adds while the US takes no position on the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands, the US acknowledges the administration of Japan over the islands. It states US opposition to any efforts to coerce, threaten to use force, or use force to resolve territorial issues. It concludes by reaffirming the commitment of the US to the Japanese government.
