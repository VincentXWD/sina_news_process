South Korea's self-employed merchants said Monday they plan to boycott Japanese products to protest Tokyo's latest sovereignty claim to a pair of islets controlled by South Korea, according to Yonhap News Agency."The boycott is to show the resolve of merchants to protect Dokdo," Oh Ho Seok, head of the Save Local Stores Alliance, was quoted as saying. Dokdo is the Korean name for the islets, which are known as Takeshima in Japanese.Organizations such as the Federation of Professional Economic-Person Societies, Voter Citizenship Behavior and Save Local Stores Alliance, which have a combined 6 million members, said they will opt not to buy or sell Japanese products starting Friday.
