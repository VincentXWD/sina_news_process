THE last radio transmission from the cockpit of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was “All right, good night,” it emerged in Beijing yesterday as relatives of missing passengers clamored for information.The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished early on Saturday without making a distress call and no confirmed wreckage has been found, despite a vast search. A total of 154 of the 239 people on board the aircraft are Chinese.Malaysia’s ambassador to China Iskandar Sarudin said that one of the pilots said “All right, good night” as the flight switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace, according to Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper.Malaysia’s department of civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman later confirmed that those were the last words heard from the passenger jet’s cockpit.At a hotel in Beijing, relatives said they were now ready to accept payments of 31,000 yuan (US$5,000) which the airline had earlier described as “comfort” money, provided during “difficult times.”They had earlier asked for the terms to be reviewed, but one said: “I don’t think this is an issue anymore for most of us.”A copy of the acceptance form says: “The airline offers the money out of kindness and it will not offset any final compensation.”Some of the family members have traveled to Malaysia to be closer to the search effort, but most have not.“I am not sleeping or eating well,” said one. “I am not thinking of going to Malaysia. What can I do there? I would rather stay in my own country.”(Agencies)
