"Sending aircraft to locate the missing plane is considered as part of international rescue operations."Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared from radar early Saturday morning, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing, with 239 people from at least a dozen countries, including China, the U.S. and Indonesia, on board.The international hunt initially focused on the South China Sea, east of Malaysia, along the plane's intended route. Navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia have expanded their search westward toward India to find clues about the missing airline.(Agencies)
