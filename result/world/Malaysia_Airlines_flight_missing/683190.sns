KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak prayed for the passengers and crew on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in a mosque near Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Friday.About a thousand Muslims living nearby came to the mosque for their regular prayer before Najib and other citizens prayed for the passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 777-200 jetliner seven days after it lost contact in the early hours of Saturday.Najib did not make any comment on the futile search efforts for the missing plane involving aircraft and vessels from a dozen countries.Mohammad Hafiz, who hosted the prayer, said he prayed for 239 people on board everyday since Saturday, and he will continue to do so until the plane is found.Shamsani, a citizen who participated in the prayer, said he hoped that all of the passengers and crew members could come home soon.The flight MH370 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, including 154 Chinese, left Kuala Lumpur at 0:41 a.m. local time on Saturday and was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m..
