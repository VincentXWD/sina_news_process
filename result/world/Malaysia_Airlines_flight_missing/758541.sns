When a mother called her son's mobile phone eight months after he was lost onboard the missing MH370 flight from Malaysia, a woman in Changsha, Central China's Hunan province answered to her surprise.A Unicom agent has revealed that when a young teacher purchased a phone card with a number ending in 7789 on November 24, she started receiving calls from relatives of one of the MH370 passengers. Upset, she returned the phonecard and asked for help.The store owner, feeling dubious and trying the card on his own phone, also received similar calls, with most callers hailing from Britain and other countries.Unicom staff said it is possible that the phone number had been reactivated after being suspended. The original card owner is currently waiting for a solution to the problem."I call my son every day. It is a comfort for us, even if we cannot be connected," said the passenger's mother. The father added that their son's disappearance was a huge blow for the family. They appealed for respect and understanding during this difficult time.
