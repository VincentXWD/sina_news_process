Nearly 300 were killed when a Malaysian airliner crashed in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels are battling government forces, an adviser to the country's interior minister said on Thursday.Malaysia Airlines said via its Twitter feed on Thursday it had lost contact with flight MH17 from Amsterdam at 1415 GMT."The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace," it said.The plane was found burning on the ground in eastern Ukraine, an aviation source told Reuters.The Boeing 777 plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. A Reuters reporter on site saw dozens of bodies scattered around the smoldering wreckage of a passenger jet.An emergency services rescue worker said at least 100 bodies had so far been found at the scene, near the village of Grabovo, and that debris from the wreckage was scattered across an area up to about 15 kilometers in diameter.Broken pieces of the wings were marked with blue and red paint - the same colors as Malaysian Airlines' emblem.The Ukrainian president said that the Malaysia Airlines jet may have been shot down. The Ukrainian interior ministry adviser was quoted by Interfax as saying that the plane was brought down by a ground-to-air BUK missile.Eastern Ukraine separatist leader Alexander Borodai was quoted as saying that the airliner was shot down by Ukrainian government forces. Kiev has denied involvementUkrainian armed forces were not involved in the crash, Interfax said, quoting Ukraine's presidential press service."This is the third event in the last few days following An-26 and SU-25 planes being brought down. We do not exclude that this plane was also shot down and we stress that the armed forces of Ukraine did not carry out any action to destroy targets in the air," the press service said.President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone on Thursday and discussed the Malaysian airliner crash.The route taken by the Malaysian flight is very common between Kuala Lumpur and the Netherlands, said CNN aviation safety consultant Mary Schiavo. She noted that the plane was flying over a troubled area and said close communication with air traffic controllers would be a key necessity.Shi Yinhong, a professor with the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that if the plane really was shot down, then the most important question is by whom."It's a national disaster for Malaysia, and one which will make the whole world pay more attention to the chaotic situation in Ukraine," he said.Russia slams sanctions as blackmailThe Russian foreign ministry reacted to fresh US sanctions, issued in the wake of escalating fighting in eastern Ukraine, in a furious statement on Thursday: "We do not intend to tolerate blackmail and reserve the right to take retaliatory measures" against the US.Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier warned that sanctions would also harm American interests.Ukraine hailed the tougher sanctions, with Western-backed President Petro Poroshenko saying he welcomed the EU moves that involve the European Investment Bank and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development halting finance for projects in Russia.(Agencies)
