LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday the tragedy of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash was "a huge blow" to Britain's allies, urging European countries to take real actions to face up to the "implications" of what is happening in eastern Ukraine."We must turn this moment of outrage into a moment of action. Action to find those who committed this crime and bring them to justice. But this goes much wider than justice," Cameron wrote in an article published by British newspaper the Sunday Times."There has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine," he said in the article.He hinted that some European countries "seem more anxious to make the Ukraine crisis a problem to be managed and contained" rather than "a challenge to be met and mastered.""Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia" if it does not change its approach to Ukraine, he added."This is not about military action, plainly. But it is time to make our power, influence and resources count," he wrote.In his article, Cameron claimed that "growing weight of evidence points to a clear conclusion: that flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area.""In Europe we should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries," he warned.Stressing that Britain does not seek a relationship of confrontation with Russia, the prime minister urged European partners to stand up for "the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent."In the article, he called for long-term solutions to the relations among Ukraine, the European Union, Russia, NATO and the wider West."We must establish proper long-term relationships between Ukraine and the European Union; between Ukraine and Russia; and, above all, between Russia and the European Union, NATO and the wider West," he wrote.He also called for "immediate access" to the crash site and preservation of the crime scene, adding "there must be a ceasefire. And there must be a full investigation into what happened.""Russia must immediately halt supplies and training for the rebels. They do not represent the people of Ukraine. Without Russian support they will wither," he noted.A Malaysia Airlines passenger plane crashed in eastern Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard.Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry agreed on Saturday the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) should be given leading role in investigating the Malaysian plane crash in Ukraine.Also on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the importance of a "thorough and impartial" investigation into all circumstances of the crash in eastern Ukraine.
