MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to join the international investigation led by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) into the crash of the Malaysian Airlines MH17, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday."Russia is closely watching the investigation into the cause of the Malaysian plane accident," the ministry said.The ministry welcomed the transfer of the plane's flight data recorders to Malaysian officials. "We hope that they will subsequently be handed over to the ICAO-led international group of experts whom Russia is ready to join."The train carrying the remains of victims departed from Torez late Monday night and arrived Tuesday noon in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, while the black boxes were handed over to Malaysian investigators in Donetsk early Tuesday.The UN Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted a resolution demanding access to the crash site and "a full, thorough and independent international investigation" into the incident.Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier emphasized the need to urge Kiev authorities for investigating the crash."We'll do everything possible to influence militia in the eastern Ukraine," Putin said at a Russian Security Council meeting on Tuesday. "But it is insufficient. It is necessary to urge the Kiev authorities to observe the basic norms of decency and cease fire for the investigation."He expressed indignation over Ukraine's tank attack against Donetsk when the black boxes were given to Malaysian experts by the militia.Putin also said Russia will maintain further contacts with partners to resolve issues for a transparent and thorough investigation of the tragedy.
