LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The data from the black boxes of the crashed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 have been passed to the Netherlands, with preliminary findings expected to be published next week, a Downing Street spokesperson said Tuesday.The black box recorders from MH17 flight were delivered last week by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) to the headquarters of the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) for data downloading and analysis.British Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR) meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the latest information on the MH17 plane disaster and Britain钬檚 response."The immediate priority is still to secure unhindered access to the site to ensure that international experts can recover any further bodies and victims钬？personal possessions; and air accident investigators can review the site and the wreckage," a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement following the meeting.The spokesperson added that the process for identifying and repatriating the victims continues in the Netherlands and there are 15 British police officers working as part of a 200 strong team to complete the process as swiftly as possible."The Prime Minister made clear that the UK should continue to play an active role in the investigation, including any criminal investigation that is expected to follow," the statement noted.Following the meeting, Cameron also met with relatives of the British victims of the crash at Downing Street, expressing his condolences for their loss.The discussion focused on the repatriation process, the investigation and how to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again, the statement said."He made clear that the Government was determined to do all it can to support them over the coming difficult months, from ensuring that their loved ones are brought home as soon as possible to bring justice to those responsible for shooting down the passenger jet," it continued.U.S. and European leaders agreed on Monday to impose wider sanctions against Russia this week, while Moscow and Kiev continued to trade accusations over the escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine.The ill-fated Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, a Boeing 777 airliner, went down on July 17 in the restive east of Ukraine, claiming all 298 lives on board.Although the Ukrainian government and insurgents in the eastern region have traded barbs over the downing of the plane, aviation experts have said it was too early to speculate on the causes before the international investigation ended.
