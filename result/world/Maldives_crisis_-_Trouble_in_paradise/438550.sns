MALE, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Maldives has said Wednesday was the worst day in the modern history of the island nation as spate of violence by opposition protestors broke out on the day.Newly appointed Minister of Home Affairs, Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahamed, on Thursday blamed former President Mohamed Nasheed and his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) for instigating violence by destroying public property and claimed that they should be responsible for the current crisis in the country.Jameel Ahamed was one of the two officials appointed President Mohamed Waheed after he took over power from former President Nasheed who later claimed he was overthrown by a coup.Jameel Ahamed complained about the incidents of violence erupted after Wednesday's National Council meeting in which Nasheed called on the public to protest against President Waheed' s government. "The people who gathered were responsible people in the sense there was former president and members of parliament. These are people whom we hope would uphold the law." "It is utterly disgusting and a sad day in the country's history,"Jameel Ahamed said.Following violence in the island nation, a criminal court on Thursday issued an order to arrest Nasheed and his defence minister.
