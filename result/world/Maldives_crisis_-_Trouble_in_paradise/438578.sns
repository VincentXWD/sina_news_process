MALE, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed urged the United States and the international community not to recognize Maldives' newly formed government under Dr. Mohamed Waheed.Nasheed told media from his home that the United States and other countries must intervene and bring democracy to the crisis ridden Indian Ocean island nation."We want international nations to reform the judiciary of Maldives, mutiny-led police and conduct a free and fair election," Nasheed said on Thursday."What we want is to bring the whole country back to the democratic process we have started," Nasheed, the first democratically elected president ending 30 years of the single- party-run government in 2008 said.He also affirmed that he would not leave the country. "How can I do that, if I leave the whole country will go to dogs," he told media. He said he was going to contest in the election due in 2013 and was certain to win it handsomely.Nasheed's invitation for U.S. intervention came amidst announcement by U.S. State Department that the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Robert O Blake who is on a tour in the region is to visit Maldives on Saturday.Nasheed said the police had arrested some 250 supporters of his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) so far and appealed to his supporters to remain calm.Maldivian police said on Thursday that they had received a court order to arrest Nasheed. Police spokesman Abdul Mannan Yoosuf told Xinhua "We have obtained an order from the Criminal Court to arrest former president."He said Nasheed would be arrested along with former defense minister.The arrest warrant was issued following a string of arson attacks on police stations and court houses by supporters of MDP on Wednesday.Nasheed resigned on Tuesday amid protests over the detention of a top judge and was replaced by Vice President Mohamed Waheed.
