COLOMBO, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Maldivian opposition on Tuesday reiterated calls for an early election following a leaked audio recording in which a government official has allegedly said that former President Mohamed Nasheed was indeed ousted in a coup.The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) said that a senior political advisor of Maldives President Mohamed Waheed, former Attorney-General Hassan Saeed, has publicly admitted that Nasheed was ousted in a coup and that Waheed assumed the presidency following the coup.MDP Spokesperson for International Affairs Hamid Abdul Ghafoor said in a statement that officially Waheed's regime, made up mainly of people close to the former autocratic President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, and hard-line Islamic preachers, continue to deny that there was a coup."According to their public statements, Nasheed stepped down voluntarily and ceded the presidency to Waheed. In reality, in the days prior to the coup, the-then Vice President Waheed had repeatedly assured opposition groups that should Nasheed be forced out, he would step into the breach," Ghafoor said.Ghafoor claimed that last week Saeed had told a group of students in London that the removal of Nasheed was indeed a "coup" though a "very unique" kind of coup.The President's Office has, however, claimed that Saeed's comments were taken out of context."It's more than clear to us that this is a police and military backed coup. We must hold early elections to give back our people their right to elect a legitimate government," Ghafoor said.Violence broke out in the Maldives earlier this month after Nasheed resigned as president following protests over his sacking of a criminal judge.Nasheed initially said he stepped down as a result of the protests but later said he was forced to resign at gun-point.The Maldives government last week said it had appointed a commission to investigate Nasheed's claims and also agreed to hold an early election but a date was not fixed.
