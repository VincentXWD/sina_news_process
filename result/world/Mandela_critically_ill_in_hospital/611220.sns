CAPE TOWN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ailing former South African President Nelson Mandela is showing "sustained improvement" but is still in a critical condition, the presidency said on Monday."Mandela is still in a critical condition in hospital, but shows sustained improvement," presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said.He made the statement after President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela on Monday morning.Zuma assured Mandela of "love and support of all South Africans", Maharaj said.Zuma urged people to keep their prayers for Mandela who spend his 44th day in hospital since June 8, his longest hospital stay in years.This was the first official update on Mandela's health since July 18 which was Mandela's 95th birthday."The birthday celebrations for the former president on the 18th of July were the biggest ever this year, attracting scores of South Africans who engaged in community service in honour of Madiba (Mandela's clan name)," Maharaj said.Earlier on Monday, Mandela's grandson Mandla said his grandfather "is gaining strength every day."Mandela will have his life support machines switched off, Mandla said in a statement after visiting his grandfather over the weekend.The improvement in Mandela's health is encouraging, Mandla said, adding that his grandfather continues to prove he has a fighting spirit.The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been suffering from a recurring lung infection which is the result of tuberculosis developed when he was imprisoned during the apartheid period.
