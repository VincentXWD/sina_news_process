By Vienna MaCANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott on Saturday joined international condemnation of "brutal and shocking" twin shooting and bomb attacks in Norway that have claimed at least 91 lives.Police arrested a 32-year-old Norwegian man after the alleged gunman, armed with an automatic rifle and dressed as a policeman, went on a shooting rampage at a political youth conference on Utoeya Island, leading to at least 84 people died.That attack came just hours after a huge bomb ripped through the heart of Oslo, killing at least seven people after it was detonated outside the government building housing the prime minister's office.Gillard said Norway was a good friend and partner of Australia, and Australia condemns the brutal and shocking attacks which occurred in Norway overnight."A number of people have been killed and many more injured. Survivors have lived through a nightmare," Gillard said in a statement released on Saturday."Our sorrow and concern are with people of Norway and in particular with the families of those who have lost loved ones and those who have been injured."Norway's prime minister has said that Norwegian democracy will not be shaken by these events and has expressed his determination to bring the perpetrators to justice."Australia stands ready to assist in any way we can."Meanwhile, Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said Australians would be appalled by the "brutal and shocking attacks on the people of Oslo.""Obviously it is important to establish who was responsible for these outrages," he said in a statement on Saturday."Norway is a good friend of Australia and the coalition will give its full support for any assistance offered by the federal government."Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said the attack on young people at youth camp of the Norwegian Labor Party is disgusting and abhorrent, and called on the world to show solidarity with Norway.A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) spokeswoman confirmed that no Australians were known to have been killed or injured in the attacks, but checks were being made to confirm all were safe.
