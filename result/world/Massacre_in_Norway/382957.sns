BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The latest twin massacres in Norway committed by a confessed ultra-rightist sounded an alarm in Europe that ultra-rightism is resurging there, posing a severe challenge to the continent's social order.Breivik, a Christian fundamentalist and once a member of Norway's right-wing populist party, is a typical ultra-rightist. And his heinous deeds tell the world what a pressing task it is for the European countries to contain the spread of ultra-rightism while keeping the mainstream values dominant.After the Second World War, the crackdown on the Nazi has nearly wiped out ultra-rightism in Europe. The mainstream values support such notions as "racial equality" and "multi-culturalism." The European society, therefore, was tolerant of immigration.After the War, West Europe, due to a shortage of labor, has witnessed a an increasingly large number of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa.With time passing by, ethnic integration has turned out to be a headache for some European countries due to huge differences in culture and lifestyle of various ethnic groups.The immigrants' general low-level education, disorderly behavior and overdependence on social welfare have become the breeding ground for xenophobic ultra-rightism in several countries.In recent years, the stagnated European economy has served as a fresh catalyst for ultra-rightism as the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis dented the European economy, raised unemployment rate and aroused some people's anti-foreign sentiment.In Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Austria and some other European countries, voices of ultra-rightism were heard from time to time in mainstream politics.Ultra-right organizations such as Skinhead and Autonomous Nationalists have frequently launched violent protests in the streets, damaging properties and posing a threat to the life of the public. In 2008, more than 20,000 crimes were conducted by rightists in Germany alone.The rightist wave is impacting the political order in Europe. Some ultra-right parties gained seats in parliament and several parties even won posts in government, forcing these countries to tighten their policy on cultural tolerance.The bloody attacks in Norway have alarmed the whole Europe that the ultra-right wave is crossing the line and moving toward the extremism of endangering people's life and the society.
