UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Norway will not be intimidated out of civic participation by the violent attack on a youth summer camp that took place July 22, Gjermund Saether, charge d'affaires of the permanent mission of Norway to the UN said here on Monday."They will not be terrorized into silence," Saether told a high- level General Assembly meeting on youth that began here Monday. " By staying engaged they will demonstrate that violence against opinion is ineffective."The July 22 attack on a Norwegian Labor Party youth camp on the island of Utoya, which came only hours after bombings of government buildings in Oslo, resulted in the deaths of more than 80 young people. Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year old Norwegian who has demonstrated extremist tendencies, has admitted to carrying out the crimes, which resulted in a total death toll of over 90.Saether said that the youth gathered at Utoya were "driven by their belief in democracy, diversity and inclusiveness" as well as their "right and duty" to participate in the political life of Norway."This youth conference ought to be about the rights and values that were attacked last Friday," he said. "It should be about the right and opportunity of young people to participate in public life. The right to shape and express their own opinions, to organize freely."The General Assembly's high-level meeting on youth which runs from July 25-26, opened with a thematic panel discussion dealt with the issues of international cooperation regarding youth as well as active youth participation and mutual understanding to help with social integration, employment and poverty eradication.According to Saether, Norway and its youth will show even more democracy, openness, participation, and humanity as a response to the July 22 attacks."In fact, over the years the Labor Youth of Norway has sent many youth representatives to the UN. We trust that they will do so again," he said.Saether also thanked the international community for the condolences they have expressed for Norway in the past few days.
