Anders Breivik's Manifesto: What drove him to kill?

Anders Breivik, having perpetrated the most heinous terrorist massacre since the Madrid train bombing, has pleaded not guilty in an Oslo court. Information about what led Breivik to kill dozens of people has started to come to light.Breivik published a 1,500-page, rambling manifesto under the title "2083: A European Declaration of Independence" in which he related his twisted, but eclectic political philosophy. It is a critique of Marxism, Islamo fascism, political correctness, and multiculturalism. Superficially, parts of the manifesto reads like the ravings of a right wing lunatic, as written down by a Hollywood screenwriter.However, there are entire passages that seem to be copied from the manifesto of Ted Kaczenski, the Unibomber, who had a problem with modern technology. There are references to the Knights Templar, a medieval chivalric order that started its existence battling Muslim forces during the Crusades, but later became one of the most powerful groups in Europe. Breivik apparently considered himself a member of a modern manifestation of the Templers.Breivik was also a fan of violent video games, such as "Call of Duty," which he claimed he used to train in mass murder. He was also a fan of the American TV shows "The Shield" about a group of rogue police officers and "Dexter" about an ethical serial killer. He also read classic literature such as "The Odyssey," "War and Peace," and "1984."Mollie Hemmingway suggests a more complex assessment of Breivik is needed rather than the stereotype of the violent, right wing nut "We learn that he's a Protestant (of his own 'free will') who wishes that the Church of Norway would just convert back to Rome, he dislikes priests who wear jeans and support Palestinians, and that he thinks the modern church is dying. We know from other evidence that he is a Free Mason."Meanwhile, the deputy police chief announced that the shooter was a 'Christian fundamentalist' but no one has reported either the evidence for the claim or how the police determined that. Whatever the case, he may be the only Freemason, Rome-leaning, Protestant fundamentalist in the world."Hemmingway poses the question: what was it about Breivik's anti-Muslim beliefs that caused him to blow up and mow down not the Muslims he apparently hated, but his fellow fair haired, fair skinned Norwegians? It is possible, like Charles Manson who killed wealthy, white people in an attempt to start a race war, Breivik killed white Norwegians to start the crusade that he fervently believed was needed to save Europe from the Islamists. In any event, profiling Breivik should be a top priority for law enforcement so that his kind can be spotted in time before they kill. (Agencies)
