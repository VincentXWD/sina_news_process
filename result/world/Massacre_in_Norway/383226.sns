OSLO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian suspect Anders Behring Breivik who claimed responsibility of Friday's twin attacks during which 76 people were killed is in all likelihood "insane," his lawyer Geir Lippestad told press on Tuesday."He looks upon himself as a warrior. He starts this war and takes some kind of pride in that," Lippestad said.According to the lawyer, Breivik felt surprised that he succeeded and expected to be killed during the attack, while believing that the war he hoped to spark is now "under way.""He thought he'd be killed after the bombing, after the action on the island, and he also thought he'd be killed at trial," Lippestad said.Lippestad said he would quit if Breivik did not agree to psychological tests.
