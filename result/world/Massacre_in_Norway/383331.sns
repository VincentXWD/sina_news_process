WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden visited the residence of the Norwegian ambassador on Tuesday to offer their condolences after twin attacks killed 76 people in the North European country last week, the White House said.It said that Obama spent several minutes writing a note in a condolence book at the ambassador's residence in Washington. He wrote: "To the people of Norway -- we are heartbroken by the tragic loss of so many people, particularly youth with the fullness of life ahead of them. No words can ease the sorrow but please know that the thoughts and prayers of all Americans are with the people of Norway, and that we will stand beside you every step of the way.""We're devastated by it, but we will stand with you," he told a small group of Norwegian officials standing by.Biden also wrote a note for several minutes as Obama stood by, while Obama's wife Michelle and Biden's wife Jill asked their husbands to deliver their own hand-written condolence letters, the White House said.Obama sent his condolences on Friday soon after a massive bomb attack in Norway's capital city of Oslo and a subsequent shooting massacre on a nearby island, that have left 76 people dead and nearly 100 wounded.
