OSLO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A new round of interrogation will be conducted Friday on Anders Behring Breivik, the suspect of Oslo bomb and shooting attacks, while the police had ended search for the last of those missing.Police attorney Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told media in Thursday afternoon that the interrogation is expected to last relatively longer than the previous one through which Breivik had undergone Saturday.Apart from that, Kraby also mentioned about the possibility of a series of interrogations on the suspect in the future, but also said it was difficult to say how often it will be carried out.The police attorney did not give any details on whether the accused would be brought to any additional charges."I must be careful not to go in the indictment," he said, adding that it was still to early to tell whether the charges should be expanded to include crimes against humanity.Norwegian police said on the same day that they had ended a six-day search for the last of those missing around Utoeya island, where 68 people were killed in a gun rampage."I can confirm that the search around Utoeya has now ended," Johan Fredriksen, a leading Olso police official, told a press conference, a day after officers said one person was still unaccounted for.
