In Brussels, senior EU counter-terrorism adviser Tim Jones said someone could try to emulate Breivik."One of the major risks is that somebody may actually try to mount a similar attack as a copycat attack or as a way of showing support," he told reporters.Austria's main far-right party, sensitive to criticism about its anti-foreigner stance as it seeks election in 2013, expelled one of its parliamentary representatives on Thursday for comments about the Norway attacks.Freedom Party official Werner Koenigshofer wrote on social networking site Facebook that "the Islamists in Europe have attacked a thousand times more often," and on his website said the massacre of children should make people rethink abortion.The remarks were widely reported in Austrian media before disappearing from the web. "He got the red card because of this behavior, which is damaging for the party," Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache said in a statement."NOT HUMAN"Norway has promised a review of the country's security services and their actions during Breivik's attacks. Police have come under criticism, including from some survivors, for taking an hour to get to the island 42 km (28 miles) from Oslo.On a pier jutting out from a campsite across the lake from Utoeya, where some survivors first reached shore, mourners laid flowers, lit candles and left messages for the dead.Pictures and children's drawings adorned the site. One crayon drawing showed the green island and dozens of faces in the waters around it."What happened here is not human," said social worker Heidi Weum Knutsen, looking out at Utoeya. "Young innocent people were hunted down and killed. That is the worst thing someone can do."Paramedic Haavard Larsen, who coordinated the health services' response to the shootings last Friday, said many survivors had been completely silent when they reached shore."It's difficult to describe but if you saw old movies from concentration camps, that was a little bit their impression -- empty looks, extremely traumatized," Larsen said."One of my colleagues was trying to help a child ashore, and the kid stepped back and asked -- 'are you going to shoot me?'"Clinical psychologist Therese Brask-Rustad, who has helped the victim's families, said Breivik intentionally played on Norwegians' overwhelming trust in the police force of the affluent and usually peaceful Nordic state."He shattered their belief about who can be trusted. Shattered their assumptions about the world. It's a wonderful holiday island that became a nightmare."(Agencies)[Previous]　[1]　[2]
