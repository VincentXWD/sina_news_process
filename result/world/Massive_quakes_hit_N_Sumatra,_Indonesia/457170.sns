WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cancelled a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean Wednesday, saying the threat "had diminished or is over."The center issued the warning after a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck about 500 kilometers off Indonesia's Aceh province Wednesday.The center said in a bulletin the quake had generated a significant tsunami but sea level readings now indicated the threat had diminished or passed in most areas and the alert was now cancelled."Danger to boats and coastal structures can continue for several hours due to rapid currents," it said.The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday the quake took place at a depth of 33 kilometers. It was followed by another measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale two hours later off the coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia.Aceh was hit by a severe tsunami in December 2004, which claimed hundreds of thousand lives throughout the region.
