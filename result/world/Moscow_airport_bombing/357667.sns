MOSCOW, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia would not negotiate with terrorists, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, local media reported."The moment one starts to negotiate with terrorists, the aggression rises and the number of victims rises respectively. This is a world practice -- no talks with terrorists," Putin stressed.He reminded that the attempts to talk with the terrorists in the early 1990s have led to two wars in Chechnya.It is necessary to fight "mercilessly" against terrorism and extremism, he said, calling on the Russian society to unite in the face of the terrorist threat."Any healthy society unites in the face of a threat and together repel bandits, extremists and terrorists. I am certain this is how it will be in Russia too," Putin said.Meanwhile, he said that initial investigations showed Monday's deadly bombing at Moscow's Domodedovo airport had nothing to do with the Chechen republic.However, he noted that in the current situation the state must develop social and economic conditions in the Northern Caucasus, to enhance law enforcement and special services work, and to provide transport infrastructure and places of mass gatherings with physical protection.In February, Russia will discuss anti-terror cooperation with the European Union during a Russia-European Commission meeting in Brussels.
