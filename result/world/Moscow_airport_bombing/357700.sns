News Analysis: Russia mazed on how to fight terror

MOSCOW, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Monday's terror attack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, the second deadly bombing that hit the Russian capital within 10 months, once again made people ask whether the national leaders are in control of the situation and if they have any feasible policy of countering terrorism.While Russian politicians, from president and prime minister to regional governors, have made decisively-sounding statements after the blast that left 35 people dead, analysts and experts believed the authorities actually have very little to produce in real terms.The major question for every Russian citizen is what the authorities are going to undertake to safeguard people from possible new attacks, the experts say.COUNTER-TERRORISM NEEDS NEW STRATEGYTo protect the Russian population from terrorism, law enforcement cannot only chase terrorists with guns, retired KGB Colonel Vladimir Lutsenko told Xinhua Tuesday."Everybody, from a citizen to the national leader, must realize that the nation has been at war. We should stop considering terrorists as common criminals. Terrorists behave according to a war logic, while the authorities keep thinking in terms of fighting 'peacetime' crimes," said Lutsenko, who used to chair the anti-terror department in the KGB and its successor Federal Security Service (FSB).Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday urged the government to prepare proposals to toughen passenger screening at airports."We'll have to put in place a much tougher inspection system, total inspections. It will likely take passengers longer, but it's the only way out," Medvedev said at an FSB meeting, urging to take Israel and U.S. practice as examples.The president conceded Russia's terrorist threat level was higher than in the United States.However, all these measures might very likely become a waste of resources, Lutsenko believed."Following every new attack the authorities pump more money and efforts into the technical anti-terrorism measures like setting up new bomb detectors and CCTV cameras. This is important, too, but this is fighting against consequences, not against the causes," Lutsenko said.TERROR: AN ATTRACTIVE TRADEMARK FOR YOUTH?Andrei Soldatov, leading Russian expert on terrorism and secret operations, predicted after Moscow's subway bombing in March 2010 that the security situation in Russia was unlikely to change for the better in 2011. He said the authorities had failed to "de-sacralize" the very image of a suicide bomber, which terror masters have polished thoroughly.The recent airport bombing vindicated Soldatov's gloomy predictions. Investigations showed that the Domodedovo attack was apparently conducted by one or more suicide bombers, a tactic often used by terrorists."The problem is the authorities work with young people in the poor regions in the most ineffective way possible. They organize boring conferences, publish boring articles in local newspapers, whereas 99 percent of the youth spend time on the Internet learning Islamism 'wisdom' comfortably at home," Soldatov told Xinhua."There are two extremes in Russia's political establishment on how to cope with this 'shadow' enemy. One extreme, representing law enforcement, is that there is no other way to destroy terrorism but destroying it physically. The other extreme is that terrorism can be put out entirely by money, creating new jobs etc," the expert said.However, according to him, the middle-way idea is that federal authorities must change the attitude of local population toward militants."Local residents must persuade prospective bombers, perhaps their neighbors or relatives, that there are other ways to spend their lives but to sacrifice them for jihad," Soldatov said, adding that this task could not be reached any time soon.Some experts agreed that terror masterminds have made their ideology an attractive trademark for some Russian youth."A terrorist attack conducted in a spectacular way recruits more 'cannon fodder' for the terrorism nets than some generously paid campaign in the media do," Lutsenko said.TERROR SNEAKS THROUGH CRACKS IN GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM WALLSAfter Monday's deadly blast, world leaders rushed to side with Russia in fighting terrorism.NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the bloc was together with Moscow in this fight.Remarkably, he expressed the alliance's support for Russia only a few hours after President Medvedev said Russia might deploy its first-strike nuclear missiles if NATO fails to cooperate.These two statements clearly demonstrated why and how the worldwide terror net has learnt to bypass the great powers' anti-terror "fortifications", analysts said."Terrorists openly demonstrate that contradictions between the great powers are terrorists' huge advantage. They hit both Western and Russian citizens at Domodedovo international airport, as if to say 'we will do away with you everywhere.' So far, the great powers have been unable to create a working anti-terror force," Lutsenko said."World leaders recollect they are all in the same boat only a few hours after an attack occurs. The next day they return to their usual political squabbling, while terrorists rub their hands," the expert said.
