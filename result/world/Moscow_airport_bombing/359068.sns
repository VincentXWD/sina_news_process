MOSCOW -- Russian authorities Wednesday revealed the name of the suicide bomber who killed 36 people in an attack at a Moscow airport and arrested his siblings, local reports said.A spokesman for Russian republic of Ingushetia's law enforcement said the DNA test confirmed the suicide bomber was Magomed Yevloyev, a 20-year-old man from the village of Ali-Yurt in Ingushetia's Nazran district."The blood samples taken from the suspect's relatives and the DNA obtained from the suicide bomber's remains were identical," the spokesman was quoted by local media as saying.Earlier, investigators confirmed they had already targeted the first suspect, but didn't give his name to public.On Tuesday, local reports said a court in Ingushetia's provincial capital, Magas, had ordered the arrest of Yevloyev's 15-year-old brother and the 16-year-old sister."They were detained for the suspicion of involving the terror attack," local media quoted an official as saying.On January 24, a powerful blast occurred in the arrivals zone of Russia's biggest Domodedovo airport, killing 36 people and leaving over 130 injured.Local media Tuesday said notorious Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing attack.Russia has been plagued by terror attacks for years, especially those from the Caucasus region. The lingering tensions in Chechyna and Caucasus region among anti-terrorism are threatening the country' stability.Violence is common in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia with militants frequently mounting attacks targeting police officers and authorities.Moscow has vowed to bring stability to the region via improving social services and raising pensions and salaries as measures to tackle corruption and terror infiltration.
