MOSCOW, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The suicide bomber at Moscow's Domodedovo airport had been serving in the Interior Ministry troops, commander of the Interior Troops said on Tuesday.Gen. Nikolai Rogozhkin said Magomed Yevloyev, a 20-year-old man from Russia's volatile North Caucasus republic of Ingushetia, had been serving in the local police unit in the Far East for three months.Rogozhkin said he was confident that the terrorist warlord Doku Umarov would eventually be caught.In February, Umarov in a video clip claimed the responsibility for the airport bombing on Jan. 24 that killed 36 people.Rogozhkin said that Interior troops would guarantee safety of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, a resort city in the immediate neighborhood of the troubled Northern Caucasus.However, he said, the Interior Ministry would not form any special units for the Olympics."Interior Ministry's units deployed in the Northern Caucasus don't need reinforcement," Rogozhkin said, noting that the situation there was under control.He added that Interior troops would maintain security at the train stations all over the country along with police.
