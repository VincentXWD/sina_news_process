LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday apologized for the phone-hacking by the now-closed News of the World (NoW) tabloid, but denied responsibilities for the scandal saying the "people he trusted or perhaps those they trusted" were to blame."This is the most humble day of my life," said Murdoch in a hearing with his son James Murdoch held by the culture, media and sport committee of British House of Commons.The Murdochs both expressed deep regrets for what happened to the NoW and particularly for the victims of the phone interceptions. "I would like to say just how sorry I am and just how sorry we are," James said.However, asked who should bear the blame, the 80-year-old media baron said "the people he trusted or perhaps those they trusted" are responsible.He emphasized that the News of the World was "just one percent" of his entire worldwide business and that he employed people he trusted to run these divisions.News of the World, once the most popular weekly newspaper in Britain for years, was accused of hacking into phones of celebrities, politicians and other journalists.The scandal reached a boiling point when the paper was found to have hacked into the phone of 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler, sparking widespread public furore.Shortly after the Murdochs' three-hour hearing ended came the session for Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of Murdoch's News Corp's British arm News International.
