A moderate earthquake has been detected at a nuclear test site in North Korea, signaling a possible nuclear test, seismologists say.The moderate earthquake, at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday, was centered at a nuclear test facility northwest of Kilju in the North's northern region. The United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 5.1.There was no immediate confirmation on whether a nuclear test had been carried out, but past nuclear tests caused readings that matched Wednesday's event. South Korea's meteorological agency said the earthquake appeared to be "man-made."North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in February 2013, leading to a new round of UN sanctions that aimed to impede the country's ability to further develop nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as its proliferation activities. Two other nuclear tests took place in 2006 and 2009.Other details were not immediately known.
