UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will on Wednesday hold consultations on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) following its announcement of first hydrogen bomb test.The closed-door consultations will be held at 11 a.m. (1600GMT), according to the UN spokesperson' office.The DPRK has been under the UNSC sanctions for its nuclear weapon program since it first tested an atomic device in 2006.The sudden announcement by the DPRK that it successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test on Wednesday morning jolted the international community, as the move may dampen the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula and threaten regional stability.The H-bomb test has been the fourth nuclear test by the country, which conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 respectively.
