WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Initial analysis indicates that the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is "not consistent" with a hydrogen bomb, the White House said Wednesday."There is nothing that's occurred in the last 24 hours that has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea's (DPRK's) technical and military capabilities," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a regular briefing.Any nuclear test conducted by the DPRK is "provocative and a flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions," Earnest added.The DPRK announced Wednesday that it has successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test.
