UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council on Wednesday "strongly" condemned the nuclear test of Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after the Council convened an emergency closed-door meeting on the DPRK.The members of the Security Council recalled that they have previously expressed their determination to take "further significant measures" in the event of another DPRK nuclear test, according to a press statement read by this month's Security Council President Elbio Rosselli, permanent representative of Uruguay.The statement said "in line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin to work immediately on such measures in a new Security Council resolution."The surprise announcement by the DPRK that it successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test Wednesday morning jolted the international community, as such a move may dampen the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula and threaten regional stability.The H-bomb test is the fourth nuclear test by the country, which has previously conducted three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 respectively.Right after the DPRK's first nuclear test, the Security Council adopted a resolution to impose sanctions on the DPRK and set up a sanctions committee.In response to nuclear tests conducted by the DPRK in 2009 and 2013, the Security Council has adopted another three resolutions to strengthen various sanctions on the DPRK, which include an arms embargo, an embargo related to nuclear, ballistic missile, and a ban on the export of luxury goods.
