Japan would consider further sanctions against the DPRK.After a magnitude-5.1 shallow-focus earthquake was detected on Wednesday in northeast part of the DPRK, the country's official media made a special report and announced it has successfully conducted its first hydrogen bomb test. The DPRK had conducted three nuclear tests before.The move prompted the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting over the issue and drew international criticism that the test jeopardized efforts to realize a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
