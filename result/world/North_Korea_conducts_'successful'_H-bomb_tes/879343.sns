Initial test results suggest that an explosion in North Korean was not a hydrogen bomb, as the state government there has claimed, US said.The initial determination of the tests, which were conducted by the United States and included seismic activity, is that it had a nuclear weapon yield in the single-digit kilotons, a U.S. official said.White House spokesman Josh Earnest echoed these sentiments in a news conference yesterday afternoon, saying that initial data is “not consistent with North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test.”
