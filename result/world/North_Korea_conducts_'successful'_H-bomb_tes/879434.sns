South Korea is limiting entry to an industrial park in North Korea jointly run by two Koreas in its first concrete action since Pyongyang said it had carried out a successful hydrogen bomb test.The Unification Ministry says visitors who are not directly related to business operations in Kaesong industrial park will be denied entry. It affects clients, potential buyers and service providers to 120 South Korean businesses in the North Korean border city.South Korean companies — mostly small- and medium-sized — make products such as watches and fashion goods with cheap labor from North Korea. The park, which employs about 53,000 North Koreans, is the last major inter-Korean project from the era of rapprochement.
