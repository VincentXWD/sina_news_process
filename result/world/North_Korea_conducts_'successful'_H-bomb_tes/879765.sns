SEOUL, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputy defense ministers of South Korea, the United States and Japan on Friday held a video teleconference to share information on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s nuclear test.Attending the conference were Yoo Jeh-Seung, South Korea's deputy minister for policy, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs David Shear and Japanese director-general of defense policy bureau Satoshi Maeda, local media reported.The three deputy ministers agreed that the DPRK's fourth nuclear test was in clear breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions and a serious threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.Reaffirming that the DPRK has not been, and will not be, accepted as a nuclear state, they agreed to maintain close cooperation in sharing information on the DPRK's nuclear threats.Seoul and Tokyo share military intelligence through Washington as the two countries failed to strike a deal on sharing bilateral intelligence in 2012 due to negative sentiment among South Koreans about signing such a deal with the former colonial ruler.
