U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet based in Yokosuka, Japan, says the Navy is watching North Korea closely after the country conducted its fourth nuclear test.Aucoin told reporters Friday morning that the Navy has ships in the area and is monitoring very closely, and added that he could not be more specific.He says, "We want them to abandon any nuclear activities and comply with the international commitments and obligations. Until they do that they're not going to achieve prosperity, they're not going to achieve the security they desire. They're going to live in isolation."Aucoin spoke aboard the USS Ronald Reagan at the Yokosuka naval base.
