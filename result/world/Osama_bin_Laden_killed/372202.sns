Muslims offered funeral prayers for Osama bin Laden in many countries, May 6, 2011. This is the first Friday prayers after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed early May 2 in a U.S. special forces assault on a Pakistani compound, in an end to the long manhunt, for whom many considered to the guiding star of global terrorism.
