ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has started inquiry into the violation of its airspace by the US military helicopters and the country's information minister says the report will be made public.US helicopters entered deep into Pakistani airspace between May 1 and 2 and the US Navy SEALs raided a compound in the outskirts of the northwestern city of Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden.US helicopters are believed to have flown from Afghanistan's eastern Ningrahar province and avoided Pakistan's radar system to reach Abbottabad, over 200 kilometers from the Pak-Afghan border.Critics are questioning as to how Pakistani authorities had been unaware of the intrusion by the US military helicopters, which entered deep into Pakistani territory and conducted some 40- minute operation.Official sources said that the PAF committee has found in initial investigation that radar system along Pakistan's western border had been functioning as normal at Peshawar and the town of Risalpur, where Pakistan Air Force has a main air base."These radars detected movement of aircraft in Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad," sources said. Jalalabad is the capital of Ningrahar province, which border Pakistan's Khyber tribal agency. Pakistani radar intercepted around six fighter and AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) planes over Jalalabad, which did not enter Pakistani air space.The committee will investigate the aspect that the US aircraft were in action just to divert attention of Pakistani radars from the helicopters.Sources said that a PAF group captain is heading the investigation committee which has started interviews of those who were on duty on the night of May 1 when the US helicopters crossed the border. They have also started record of that night.The committee has started inquiry at a time when the US officials have asked Pakistan to probe as to who facilitated the world most wanted man to stay in Abbottabad. The United States has also called for access to the three widows of slain Osama bin Laden, who are now in custody of the Pakistani authorities.One of the three widows told Pakistani investigators that Osama lived for five years at the same compound where he was killed along with his son and two Kuwait-born Pakistani brothers. She also disclosed that they lived at a small village Chak Shah Mohammad near Haripur, a main city some 30 kilometers from Abbottabad.Sources said that more inquiry committees of intelligence officials will soon be formed to hold investigation. The PAF inquiry committee will find out why the active radars could not detect the US helicopters.  Pakistan Information Minister Firdus Ashiq Awan said that the government will publish details of the US Special Forces operation to kill Osama bin Laden."We will definitely take the nation into confidence and make public the real facts about the incident," she said. Talking to a private news channel, Firdous said no abrupt statement on the sensitive incident may be issued without ascertaining the facts.Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, will make a policy statement later on Monday on the US Special Forces operation, the PM office said.The government is under harsh criticism by the opposition groups and sections of society, demanding him to tell the nation about the US operation and the presence of the most wanted man in Pakistan."The Prime Minister will take the nation into confidence through the platform of the Parliament on Monday, and looks forward to a full debate on the matter on the floor of the House," a statement from the PM office said.The prime minister on Saturday held extensive consultations with the president, the defense minister, the minister of State for Foreign Affairs and chief of the Army Staff on the situation arising from the Abbottabad operation, it said.
