ISLAMABAD- Pakistan Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Monday rejected allegations that the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. troops in the country showed Pakistani incompetence or complicity in hiding the al Qaeda leader."Allegations of complicity or incompetence are absurd," Gilani told parliament, adding that it was disingenuous for anyone to accuse Pakistan, including its spy agency, of "being in cahoots" with the al Qaeda network.Gilani said unilateral actions such as the U.S. Navy SEALs swoop on bin Laden'ss hideout ran the risk of serious consequences, but added Pakistan attached high importance to its relations with Washington.
