Pakistani government and military have been facing a rising pressure from opposition political parties and public to know about the real role of the institutions. Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, during his address to the parliament, tried to explain his government stance and ordered a probe into the matter.But one day after his speech, opposition leader and two times former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, talking to media, rejected government's stance and demanded a judicial commission to investigate the matter of operation that earned bad name for the nation.
