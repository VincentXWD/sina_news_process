Mullah Omar is alive. He is inside Afghanistan and is leading Mujahideen against foreign troops," Zabihulla Mujahid told media on Monday.Mullah Omar had escaped the massive U.S. military manhunt in the region since the collapse of his regime in late 2001 by U.S- led military campaign would be a big blow to his fighters operating in Afghanistan.U.S. forces during a special operation killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan on May 2.
