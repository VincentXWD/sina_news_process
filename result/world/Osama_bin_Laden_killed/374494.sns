ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The killing of al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani northwestern garrison city by the U.S. navy SEALs on May 2, has multiplied risks for this Muslim nation for an incident the country's security had not been involved.The U.S. unilateral action to kill the world most wanted man has already put the Pakistani security agencies in the state of embarrassment as the CIA blamed Pakistan of "either involved" in sheltering Osama or "incompetent" to know about his whereabouts.Pakistan was struggling how to remove the bad impression about intelligence failure on Osama bin Laden in a compound in the city of Abbotabad but the Taliban militants launched brazen attacks on the security forces to take revenge of his death.Pakistan has no role in the killing of Osama bin Laden as the top U.S. officials confirmed that Pakistani officials were not informed about the 40-minute operation to eliminate Osama bin Laden.The Sunday night attack on a naval base in the port city of Karachi is one of the worst attacks in the insurgency-hit country as the heavily-armed militants attacked the forces' assets. Officials said that the militants fired rocket propelled grenades to damage and destroy several warplanes. These included the Pakistan navy's premier anti-submarine attack jet, the U.S. made P- 3C Orion.Interior Minister Rahman Malik said that the attack is aimed at appeasing the enemy as the attackers targeted navy assets.A spokesman for Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least seven security personnel as they lobbed grenades and fired indiscriminately and triggering gun battles that continued for over eight hours.About 12 to 15 militants, equipped with rockets, hand grenades and automatic guns targeted a naval air station, at about 10:40 p. m. local time Sunday night, sparking gunfight with the forces.Explosions were also heard Monday morning and the security forces are engaged in firing with the militants. The militants have held hostages the security personnel inside the base and spokesman for the navy said that the operation is very sensitive due to army's assets.Naval spokesman Irfan-ul-Haq told the media that four naval personnel and a paramilitary trooper were killed and nine more naval personnel injured in running gun battles. He said the security forces are trying to capture the militants alive.State-run PTV said there were unconfirmed reports that four to five terrorists had been killed or captured.The Taliban attack once again proved that they are well- organized to launch attacks anywhere in Pakistan including the highly sensitive and secured areas.Some analysts described the navy base attack similar to the 2008 Mumbai style attack, which had killed nearly 170 people. Pakistani militant group "Lashkar-e-Tayeba" was blamed for the Mumbai attacks.The Taliban spokesman said that the militants have food for three days and will fight till the last.Shortly after the Osama's death, the Pakistani Taliban and al- Qaida had declared to take revenge of his killing and carried out deadliest attacks since then.On May 13, twin bomb attacks on a paramilitary force academy in north-west Pakistan killed 80 people and injured more than 100 others.Taliban were quick to claim responsibility for attacks at the training center for the Frontier Constabulary in Shabqadar in northwestern Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province, to avenge the killing of Osama bin Laden.Few more attacks were also carried out by Pakistani Taliban for Osama's death, raising fear for more such attacks in the future. The Taliban, whose suicide network is still functioning in North Waziristan tribal region, are posing challenge to the Pakistani security agencies.Pakistani media Monday pointed out to weaknesses in the country 's intelligence system and their failure to get information about the Taliban network. It is time for more vigilance and improvement in the security system to check the militants before they strike.
