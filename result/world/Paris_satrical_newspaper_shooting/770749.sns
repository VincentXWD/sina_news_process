OTTAWA, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper condemned the deadly shooting at a French magazine that killed 12 people on Wednesday, branding it a "barbaric act" and offering condolences to the victims and their families."Canadians stand with France on this dark day," Harper said in a statement, urging that perpetrators of the attack must be apprehended and brought to justice."This barbaric act, along with recent attacks in Sydney, Saint- Jean-sur-Richelieu, and Ottawa, is a grim reminder that no country is immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world," he said.Masked gunmen on Wednesday stormed the Paris offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo that caricatured the Prophet Mohammad, killing 12 people, including the editor and two policemen before escaping in a car.A major police operation is underway to hunt down the fleeing gunmen."Canada and its allies will not be intimidated and will continue to stand firmly together against terrorists who would threaten the peace, freedom and democracy our countries so dearly value," the Canadian prime minister said.
