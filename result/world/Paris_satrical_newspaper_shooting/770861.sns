The shooting at Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris Wednesday has evoked an outpouring of outrage and sympathy from Twitter users around the world. But perhaps the most moving response to the attack on the satirical newspaper has been that of cartoonists.Charlie Hebdo is known for its inflammatory illustrations and caricatures, sparing no one and no belief systems, from French President François Hollande to Jesus and the prophet Muhammad. So cartoonists from a variety of countries have paid tribute to the 12 victims of Wednesday’s attack the best way they know how: with cartoons. The result is a growing collection of powerful images.
