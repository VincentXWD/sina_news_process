The wife of Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers who attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, has condemned his actions and offered condolences to victims.Izzana Hamyd had been detained by investigators for 72 hours after Wednesday's act of terror, and "expressed her indignation and condemnation of violence" to officers.According to the young woman's lawyer, Christian Saint-Palais, her response to the shootings "was the same reaction as that of the entire nation", as she was "stupefied" by the attack. Ms Hamyd has now been released from custody.Speaking at a unity rally in Paris attended by more than a million people on Sunday , Mr Saint-Palais claimed his client was never given any indication that Cherif Kouachi, and his brother Said, were planning to invade the offices of the satirical magazine.After killing a dozen people - including two policemen - the Kouachi brothers went on the run for 48 hours before being tracked down at a printing warehouse northeast of Paris. They were killed after opening fire with officers.Meanwhile, the mother and sisters of a jihadist gunman who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris have also released a statement.Amedy Coulibaly's family said: "We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion."The search for Coulibaly's "armed and dangerous" girlfriend, Hayat Boumeddiene, continues - but intelligence officials believe that she travelled to Syria via Turkey before France's three days of terror began.A video has emerged which shows Coulibaly pledging allegiance to Islamic State, and describing the terror attacks as "totally legitimate and well-deserved".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he appreciates the "very firm position" taken by the French government in light of "the new anti-Semitism and terrorism" which has swept Paris.Speaking at the Grand Synagogue in the capital, he added: "Our common enemy is radical, extremist Islam - not normal Islam."The four victims of the Hyper Cacher attack - Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada - will be buried in Jerusalem, according to Mr Netanyahu, following "requests from the families of those killed in the murderous terror attack".
