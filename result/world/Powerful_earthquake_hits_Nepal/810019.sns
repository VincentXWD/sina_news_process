Nepal has been hit by another powerful earthquake, shaking buildings in the capital Kathmandu.It comes weeks after the country was devastated by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which killed at least 8,046 people and injured more than 17,800.The US Geological Survey has upgraded the latest quake from 7.1 to 7.4 magnitude.It struck near the base camp for Everest, and was measured at a shallow depth of about 19 km.The epicentre was around 40 miles west of Namche Bazar, a remote area near the China border.There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to buildings.People were seen fleeing their homes more than 50 miles away in Kathmandu as the tremors hit.The city was devastated by an earthquake on 25 April, which flattened buildings and left thousands homeless.UNICEF communications officer Rose Foley, who is in Nepal, said people sheltered under tables as buildings shook."Felt like walking on deck of boat as we made way to safety," she tweeted."Huge earthquake - shaking went on and on. Sheltering in open. Thinking of safety of children who've already suffered so much."
