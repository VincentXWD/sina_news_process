HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government on Friday approved a grant of 7 million HK dollars (about 903,000 U.S. dollars) to World Vision Hong Kong for providing relief to earthquake victims in Nepal.The government made the decision advised by the region's Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee which hoped that the grant would facilitate the provision of timely relief to the victims and help them restore their normal living.The grant is further to a disbursement of 50 million HK dollars made earlier for the government of Nepal to provide emergency relief to victims affected by the 7.9-magnitude earthquake on April 25 and 7.4-magnitude aftershock on May 12. It takes the accumulative value of grants for earthquake victims in Nepal to 57 million HK dollars.A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said to ensure that the money would be used for the designated purposes, World Vision Hong Kong would be asked to submit an evaluation report and an audited account on the use of the grant after the relief project has been completed. (1 HK dollar = 7.75 U.S. dollars)
