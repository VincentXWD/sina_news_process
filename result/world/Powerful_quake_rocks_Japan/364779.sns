SEOUL, March 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will offer water and blankets to quake-ravaged Japan in another batch of emergency relief aid, the government said here Friday.The government will on Saturday send 100 tons of bottled water and 6,000 blankets to Japan at the request of the Japanese government, and will continue discussing further aid with the neighboring country, according to the foreign ministry.Apart from donations by local governments and private enterprises, the government tapped into its reserves for relief supplies, the ministry said.South Korea, the first country to send rescue workers after last week's massive earthquake and tsunami that rattled Japan, sent earlier this week 20 tons of bottled water, 21 drums of oil and 1,500 units of protective clothing.The country is also set to offer 52.6 tons of boric acid as requested by the Japanese government.
