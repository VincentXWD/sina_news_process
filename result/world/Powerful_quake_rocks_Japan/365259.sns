An external power source became available Monday night for the No. 1 reactor at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, paving the way for electricity to be supplied to the reactor, its operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Tuesday.The external power source is now available for four of the six reactors at the nuclear power plant, which was crippled by the devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and causing radiation leaks. The four are the No. 1, 2, 5, and 6 reactors.But operations to restore power supply to the plant and spray water to cool overheated spent fuel rod pools have not been resumed due to steam and smoke from the plant.The utility company, known as TEPCO, said that what seems to be white steam continued to rise from the No. 2 reactor while white hazy smoke is rising from the No. 3 reactor.TEPCO said Monday grayish and blackish smoke was seen at the southeast of the No. 3 reactor building around 3:55 p.m. above a pool storing spent nuclear fuel, though a blast was not heard.The smoke stopped after 6 p.m. Monday but TEPCO subsequently found that white smoke was rising through a crack in the roof of the building that houses the No. 2 reactor at around 6:20 p.m.(Agencies)
