Efforts to spray water into the No. 4 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was struck by an earthquake and tsunami in Tomioka, Fukushima Prefecture, northeastern Japan, are seen in this March 22, 2011 handout photograph released by Tokyo Electric Power Co.  Power has been reconnected to all the six reactors at Japan's troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and the lighting in the control room for the No. 3 reactor was restored on Tuesday.
