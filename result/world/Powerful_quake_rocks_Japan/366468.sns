The oil tanker "Shengchi", loaded with 10,000 tons of gasoline and 10,000 tons of diesel to help earthquake relief in Japan, was ready to leave a deepwater port in China's northeastern city of Dalian for Japan on March 29, 2011. China has offered Japan 20,000 tons of fuel for free as part of its response to the quake that hit the country on March 11. The tanker is expected to arrive in Japan early next month.
