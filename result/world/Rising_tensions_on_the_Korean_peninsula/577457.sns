The parliament of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) approved the appointment of a new premier seen by outside experts as an economic reformer one day after top party officials adopted a declaration making nuclear arms and a stronger economy the nation's top priorities.The U.S., meanwhile, made its latest conspicuous display of firepower, announcing it had sent F-22 stealth fighter jets to participate in annual U.S.-South Korean war games that Pyongyang calls preparation for an invasion. The new South Korean president, who has a policy meant to re-engage Pyongyang with talks and aid, told her top military leaders Monday to set aside political considerations and respond strongly should DPRK attack.The re-emergence of Pak Pong Ju as premier at an annual spring parliamentary session is seen by analysts as a clear signal that leader Kim Jong Un is moving to back up recent vows to focus on strengthened economic development. The U.N. says two-thirds of the country's 24 million people face regular food shortages.Pak was DPRK's premier in 2003-2007, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry."Pak Pong Ju is the face of economic reform, such as it exists — reform with DPRK characteristics as they say," said John Delury, a professor and DPRK analyst at Seoul's Yonsei University.(Agencies)
