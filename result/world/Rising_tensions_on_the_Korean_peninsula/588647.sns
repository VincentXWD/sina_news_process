The United States and South Korea vowed on Tuesday to keep up their guard and not reward bad behavior by Pyongyang, which US President Barack Obama said had won no benefits or prestige from recent war threats."If Pyongyang thought its recent threats would drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States or somehow garner the North international respect, today is further evidence that North Korea has failed again," Obama said at a joint news conference with South Korean President Park Geun-hye."President Park and myself very much share the view that we are going to maintain a strong deterrent, we're not going to reward provocative behavior, but we remain open to the prospect of North Korea taking a peaceful path," he said.Obama's meeting with Park, South Korea's first female president, comes after signs of what a Pentagon spokesman called "provocation pause" by Pyongyang after nearly months of threats to attack the United States and South Korea.U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the North had taken two medium-range Musudan missiles off launch-ready status and moved them from the country's east coast.The move, which followed a relative toning down of bellicose rhetoric from the DPRK state media, could easily be reversed because the Musudan are mobile missiles, U.S. and South Korean officials cautioned.Park, 61, said the North's isolation made it difficult to figure out whether and why Pyongyang had changed tack."Why is North Korea appearing to de-escalate its threats and provocations? There is no knowing for sure," she said through a translator.U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, taking a cautious approach when asked about an apparent reduction in tensions, said the United States remained prepared for "any contingency.""We would hope that the leadership in North Korea understands that the wiser course of action is to participate in a process toward peace," Hagel told a Pentagon news briefing.Park, who took office in February just after the North conducted its third nuclear weapons test and began a 10-week campaign of near-daily treats to attack the South and U.S. territory with nuclear weapons.Daniel Russel, the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that Washington and Seoul were serious about deterring DPRK provocations and on holding Pyongyang to a denuclearization agreement."We both support incremental engagement and are prepared to support the North if they make the right decision and take steps to abide by their international obligations," he said on Monday.TRADE PACT LAUDEDObama and Park said the door remained open to returning to diplomacy, but the onus was on DPRK."So far, at least, we haven't seen actions on the part of the North Koreans that would indicate they're prepared to move in a different direction," Obama said.While DPRK loomed over Park's meeting with Obama, her visit also highlighted the 60th anniversary of a security alliance formed during the 1950-53 Korean War and South Korea's rise from poverty to become a wealthy democracy.Obama drew laughter from Park and her entourage with a nod to South Korea's growing soft power and cultural export prowess, marketed as the "Korean Wave" and embodied by rapper PSY and his quirky 2012 video and dance hit "Gangnam Style.""Around the world, people are being swept up by Korean culture, 'the Korean Wave,'" he said. "And, as I've mentioned to President Park, my daughters have taught me a pretty good 'Gangnam style.'"Park on Monday visited the Korean War Memorial in Washington honoring the 36,000 Americans killed in that conflict. On Wednesday, she will give a speech at a joint session of Congress and then have lunch with American executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.(Agencies)
