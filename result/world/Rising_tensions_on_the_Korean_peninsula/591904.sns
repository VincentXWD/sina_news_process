Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed Sunday to seek talks with Pyongyang in a bid to settle the issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s abductions of Japanese.Abe made the comment after a surprise visit to DPRK by one of his advisers last week.“I want to pursue negotiations or dialogue” with DPRK, he told reporters in Fukuoka, according to Japanese media.“I will definitely try to realize the return home of all the abduction victims, the search for truth behind the cases and the handover of the abductors during the Abe government,” he said.But he added Japan will also continue seeking a “comprehensive solution” to the abduction issue along with DPRK’s nuclear and missile ambitions.The adviser, Isao Iijima, returned home via Beijing on Saturday after the four-day visit to Pyongyang where he discussed with DPRK officials ways to resolve the long-pending abduction issue.Iijima told DPRK officials that Tokyo “would not make any move” unless they return all Japanese abductees, hand over the abductors and resolve all the abduction cases, according to Japanese media citing sources close to him.In 2002, DPRK officially admitted to the abductions but its refusal to give a fuller account of the cases has infuriated Japan.(Agencies)
