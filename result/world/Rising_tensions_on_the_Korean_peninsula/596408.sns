Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama, will discuss ways to press North Korea to rid itself of nuclear technology when they meet in California later this week, an official in Seoul said Tuesday."The United States and China share the view that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is essential if we are to move forward in any diplomatic process with North Korea," State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said at a press briefing."That's an issue that we work closely with them on. I'm sure it will be an issue discussed this weekend and moving forward."She added China is working with the U.S. and other members of the six-way talks in pressing North Korea to abide by its international obligations, including the Sept. 19, 2005, joint statement. Under the deal, Pyongyang agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons in return for political and economic incentives from South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia."We remain focused on pressing North Korea, as do, of course, the Chinese, and we have a shared goal of a denuclearized peninsula," Psaki said.Obama is scheduled to meet Xi at Sunnylands, a Southern California estate, on Friday and Saturday. It would be their first meeting since Xi became China's leader in March.White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said earlier Obama and Xi will use the rather informal sessions for wide-ranging discussions on U.S.-China relations and joint efforts to resolve regional and global challenges."Certainly a topic of conversation would be North Korea, stability in Asia, expanding our bilateral military ties, climate change and cybersecurity," he told reporters.Meanwhile, Rose Gottemoeller, acting under secretary of state for arms control and international security, will make a two-day trip to Beijing from Wednesday, her department announced.Leading the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-China Security Dialogue, she will have discussions with senior Chinese officials on arms control, nonproliferation and international security issues, it said.(Agencies)
