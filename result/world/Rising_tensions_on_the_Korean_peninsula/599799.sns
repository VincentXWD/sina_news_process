The United States will meet with South Korea and Japan in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss North Korea’s new offer to hold high-level talks, a senior administration official said on Sunday.“We will be meeting with our Japanese and South Korean partners in a trilateral setting and this will be one of the subjects for discussion,” the official said.North Korea on Sunday offered high-level talks with the United States to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, but the White House said that any talks must involve Pyongyang taking action to show it is moving toward scrapping its nuclear weapons.The offer came only days after North Korea abruptly canceled planned official talks with South Korea, the first planned talks in more two years. The North blamed the South for scuttling discussions that sought to mend estranged ties between the Koreas.The North Korea National Defence Commission in a statement carried by KCNA news agency on Sunday said Washington can pick a date and place for talks and the two sides can discuss a range of issues, but no preconditions should be attached.(Agencies)
