The United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea on Wednesday called for "meaningful" steps on denuclearization by Pyongyang in exchange for better ties with them."We agreed a path is open for the DPRK toward improved relations with the United States, Japan and the ROK if the DPRK takes meaningful steps on denuclearization," the three countries said after their envoys concluded a trilateral meeting here on issues related to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)."We reaffirmed our commitment to the Sept. 19, 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, including its core goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner," the U.S. State Department said in a statement."We will judge the DPRK by its actions, not its words," the statement said.On Sunday, the DPRK's National Defense Commission proposed high- level talks with the United States without preconditions "to defuse tension and realize regional peace and security on the Korean Peninsula."Washington has responded by insisting on "credible" steps toward concrete denuclearization by the DPRK.Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for the DPRK, had a " productive" trilateral meeting with his counterparts from Japan and the ROK, the State Department said.The trio emphasized full implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK, better inter-Korean relations and the resolution of the abduction of Japanese citizens by DPRK agents in the 1970s and 1980s, the department said."We also look forward to continuing to engage with China, Russia and other key partners on the DPRK," the agency said in its statement.
