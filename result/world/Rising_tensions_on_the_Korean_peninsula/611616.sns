China's Vice President Li Yuanchao will attend a ceremony in North Korea to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement that halted the 1950-53 Korean War, North Korean media said Wednesday.The report by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said that Li will lead a delegation of Chinese officials and that the visit has been arranged by the North's Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly and the Cabinet.In the North, the armistice day falls on July 27 and is celebrated as a day of victory in the "Fatherland Liberation War." North Korea has maintained it won the three-year conflict that ended in a stalemate with the two Koreas still technically at war since no formal peace treaty has been signed.The North's official news wire service monitored in Seoul did not give details on the date of arrival or mode of transportation for Li and the other Chinese officials, but he should arrive before the armistice day.Li, who was tapped for the vice president post in March of this year, is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit North Korea under Kim Jong-un's rule since Li Jianguo, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, paid a call in November 2012.(Agencies)
