SEOUL, July 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea repeatedly clamored for measures to prevent another stoppage of the joint industrial park in Kaesong, a border town of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)."North Korea (DPRK)'s sincere attitude toward measures to prevent recurrence (of its unilateral shutdown of the complex) lies at the core of working-level talks about the Kaesong industrial zone," Kim Hyung-seok, spokesman of the Unification Ministry, told reporters at a press briefing.The working-level dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang to normalize operations of the joint factory park in Kaesong, just north of the heavily armed border, actually broke down on Thursday after the sixth round of such talks ended up as another failure.Following the talks, Park Chol-su, Pyongyang's top delegate, told South Korean reporters that the working-level negotiation was "in danger of breakdown," warning that the DPRK may deploy its troops in Kaesong if the talks were shattered in this way.The Unification Ministry expressed deep regrets over his declaration of the dialogue breakdown, warning that the South Korean government could make "a grave resolution" unless the DPRK becomes sincere toward measures to prevent another stoppage of the complex.During the morning session of the sixth talks, the DPRK proposed to take "joint responsibility" for the factory park suspension before blaming Seoul for the stoppage in the afternoon session, spokesman Kim said, stressing that Seoul refused to accept both proposals.From start to end of the talks, Seoul called on Pyongyang to take responsibility for the damages to South Korean companies caused by its unilateral shutdown of the joint industrial zone, and provide a clear assurance to prevent recurrence of such an incident.The Kaesong industrial complex, where 123 South Korean companies run factories, has been suspended since the DPRK pulled out around 53,000 of its workers in early April in protest against the joint annual military exercises between South Korea and the United States.Seoul and Washington planned to hold another joint military drills next month, throwing away the chance to mend ties between Seoul and Pyongyang.
