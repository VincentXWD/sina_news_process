North Korea proposed Wednesday that the two Koreas hold another round of talks on Aug. 14 aimed at normalizing a joint industrial complex that has been shuttered since early April.The offer, made by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK), comes more than a week after Seoul demanded "final talks" to resolve all outstanding issues surrounding operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.The latest proposal, carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) monitored in Seoul, said the two Koreas should work together to prevent another work stoppage, like the one that occurred in early April. Pyongyang also offered safe passage to all South Koreans entering the complex.It added that the temporary ban on operations announced by the North on April 8 will be lifted.The CPRK then said that the South should accept the talks offer to resolve differences through dialogue.(Agencies)
