SEOUL, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said to South Korea that Pyongyang was anticipating fruitful results at the upcoming talks with Seoul on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex, local broadcaster YTN reported Thursday, citing South Korean Unification Ministry.Pyongyang sent this message to Seoul through the inter-Korean communication lines that run through the liaison office at the truce village of Panmunjom.The Unification Ministry said earlier that Pyongyang asked the extended duty of the liaison office without any comments on the request. The two sides exchange phone calls at 9:00 a.m. and 4 p. m. local time. South Korea and the DPRK agreed to hold the seventh round of working-level talks next Wednesday at the joint industrial park in the DPRK's border town of Kaesong. Since June, the two Koreas had held six rounds of fruitless talks on reopening the complex amid differences over conditions for the normalization. The DPRK said on the previous day that Pyongyang and Seoul should work together to prevent a recurrence of the factory park's stoppage, boosting outlooks for the upcoming talks as the recurrence prevention was called for by South Korea as a precondition for reopening the industrial zone.The Kaesong industrial complex, where 123 South Korean companies run factories, has been suspended for four months since early April when the DPRK withdrew 53,000 of its workers from the factory park in protest against the joint military drill between Seoul and Washington.
