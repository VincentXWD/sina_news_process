Middle East joins in hitting U.S.Sina English  Fresh clashes at US embassy in Cairo The United States has tightened security of its embassies in Arab countries following an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, where a team of the US Marine Corps has already been stationed.Additionally, two US destroyers have been deployed off the coast of Libya. Meanwhile, experts warn of the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East.The Arab world is starting to ‘boil’ as mass protest rallies are taking place near the US embassies in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia and Libya. Protesters are angered about the Innocence of Muslims, an anti-Islam film made in the United Sates to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Protests turned violent in the Libyan city of Benghazi, where the US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed on Tuesday night in an attack that was apparently orchestrated by al-Qaeda, according to some experts. Others say that the attack might be the work of one of the groups struggling for power in Libya. The finger of blame is specifically laid on Benghazi rebels who were irked with the results of the Libyan revolution.Libya is seeing the ongoing process of redistribution of the flows of oil money. Rebels would like to capitalize on their own efforts because they are based on the territory of oil transit supplies, where plants and terminals are located.As for Egypt, the situation there remains tense and street protests show no signs of abating, something that was, however, tackled by the Muslim Brotherhood.Representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood decided to authorize protest rallies that were earlier staged near the US embassy in Egypt. They have repeatedly warned against violence during these rallies, something that they said could even prompt the enemies of Islam crack down on Egypt and Islam on the whole.Experts fear that Americans may well respond in kind given the ongoing election campaign in the United States.
