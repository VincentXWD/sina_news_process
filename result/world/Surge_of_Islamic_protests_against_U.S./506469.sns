WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday slammed the anti-Islam video which has triggered waves of anti-American protests in a number of Muslim countries, terming it as "disgusting and reprehensible."In her televised speech, Clinton stressed that the U.S. government has nothing to do with the video. She also noted that there is "no justification" for responding to this video with violence.Clinton urged other countries' leaders to stand up and condemn the violence. "It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is to promote better understanding across countries and cultures," she said.On Tuesday night, protesters and gunmen stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya and set fire to the U.S. mission building, killing the U.S. ambassador and three other embassy staffers to protest against the anti-Islam video allegedly ridiculing Islam's Prophet Mohammad.Muslim protesters also stormed the U.S. embassies in Egypt and Yemen in the past two days.
