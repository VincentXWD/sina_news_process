By Li Hongmei, Special to Sina EnglishAn anti-American demonstration attracted more than 1,000 protesters Sunday in front of the U.S. consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi , one person killed and another eight wounded.A wave of protests triggered by a U.S.-produced film said to insult Prophet Muhammad, “Innocence of Muslims” has turned into a global tsunami, which has not merely covered the U.S. embassies, but also involves the diplomatic missions of Germany and Britain and reached closer to Israeli embassies. Also, the “anti-American fever” has spread from its epicenter in Africa and the Middle East to Asia.Thousands of people attacked the embassies of the U.S., Germany and Britain in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. Tear gas was not an obstacle to the protesters to storm the German embassy and remove the German flag and plant the flag of Islam. In Tunisia, demonstrators hurled stones at the American embassy.After Friday prayers, pogroms were carried out in Tripoli, Egypt and Yemen. Police used water cannons and fired warning shots into the air to prevent the angry crowd from lynching the American diplomatic staff.In response the U.S. is forced to defend. It is closing its embassies in Niger and Lagos and even in several countries in Western Europe. To ensure safety to American diplomats, the Pentagon has deployed marines in Libya where the U.S ambassador died in the hands of militants. An American destroyer has been sent near to the Libyan coast. Sooner or later, the “anti-American” fever will cover the entire Muslim world.The killing of the American ambassador in Benghazi is a tragedy, of course. On the one hand, it is the consequence of the policy pursued by the U.S. in the Islamic world. This policy provides for the military presence. Over million people were killed in Iraq after the American aggression.American troops are in Afghanistan. It is widely known what the price of regime change in Libya was. At the time, the West as a whole uttered no words. This also explains why anti-American sentiment in the Islamic world is very strong and wide-spread.It is quite possible that all acts of protests and pogroms in the Muslim countries have been a well-directed provocation. Somebody is clearly adding fuel to the fire between Islam and US-led West.Meanwhile, Google has restricted access to the video film in India and Indonesia and blocked it for the users in Egypt and Libya where protests have reached a highest point. According to an official of the company, the restrictions were imposed in line with the legislations of these countries but not for political reasons.Still, pogroms have shifted to Asia. Protestors burned American flags while shouting “Death to America!”, “Death Blasphemers!” in Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi and other Pakistani cities.The anti-American demonstrations in Libya, Egypt and many other countries revealed the weakness of the U.S. in developing a long-term strategy towards Arab statesPeople wonder in what way Washington would rebuild its relations with the Muslim world after all these events?Related news:  1 killed in clash between Pakistani protesters and police Indonesian Muslims protest U.S. film outside US EmbassyMore than 1,000 protest anti-Islam film in Kabul 1 dead at US Embassy in Karachi230 detained in Belgium To combat protests, US mobilises troops Base in Afghanistan attacked by insurgents U.S. military uniformsUS$3.3 million for murder of RushdiePakistani Muslims protest anti-Islam filmAnti-U.S. protests continue in Muslim world over filmAnti-Islam movie threatens Arab relations with WashingtonObama vows to "stand fast" against anti-U.S. violenceUS Ambassador killed in Libya.
