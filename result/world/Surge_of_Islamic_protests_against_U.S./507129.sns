The US has mobilized its troops in several regions of the Middle East to protect its diplomats, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told journalists during his visit to Asian countries.He said that two destroyers have been sent to the Libyan coast. The US consulate was attacked in the Libyan city of Benghazi, as a result of which the US ambassador was killed. The US ships are armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and could be used for evacuating people, Panetta said.Earlier, a special unit of US marines arrived in Benghazi to take care of the diplomatic mission.A powerful wave of anti-US protests swept several Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa, among them Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and Sudan, after the US showed the film Innocence of Muslims which defames Prophet Muhammad.
