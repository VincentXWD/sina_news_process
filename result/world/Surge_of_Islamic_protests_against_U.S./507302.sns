Protesters also tried to ignite a fire truck parked outside the embassy and Molotov cocktails exploded against a fence surrounding the embassy. Police used a bullhorn to call for calm.The demonstration started off peacefully as the group of several hundred protesters, many dressed in white, marched toward the mission.The U.S. Embassy earlier Monday issued an emergency message to American citizens, saying about 1,000 people were expected to demonstrate in front of the mission with about 1,500 police on hand.Demonstrations were also held Monday in the cities of Medan and Bandung. Over the weekend in the central Java town of Solo, protesters stormed KFC and McDonald's restaurants, forcing customers to leave and management to close the stores.The American-made film "Innocence of Muslims" ridicules Islam and depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a madman.
