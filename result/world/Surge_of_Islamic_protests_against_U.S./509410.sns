Hundreds of Muslims in Nigeria's northern state of Katsina on Sunday protested against the U. S.-made movie and the French cartoon that denigrated the Prophet Mohammed.The protesters shouted anti-U. S., France and Israel slogans with a call on the international community to punish those behind the sacrilegious movie and cartoon.They condemned those using the media to attack Islam, urging Muslims across the world to come out and protest the desecration on the person of Mohammed.They later burnt the effigy of U. S. President Barack Obama, and dragged the flags of the three countries on the streets for miles round the city.Most of the protesters were of the Shiite extract, with their leader, Sheik Ibrahim El-zazaky known for his firebrand sermons that were often anti-West.On Saturday, a similar protest was held in neighboring Kano State, where Muslims strongly condemned the anti-Islam movie and cartoon.The protesters, who were closely monitored by security men, were allowed to express their grievances on the platform of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria.Speaking to the protesters, the local leader of the Shiite group, Sheik Yakubu Yahaya, said the cartoon and movie were aimed at making a "mockery of the tenets and beliefs of Islam."Yakubu said the move was also aimed at institutionalizing the Sept. 11 event as an annual "ritual to portray Islam as a religion of terrorists."
