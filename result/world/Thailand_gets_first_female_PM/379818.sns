BANGKOK, July 4, 2011 - Thailand's powerful military accepts the opposition's landslide election victory, the outgoing defence minister told AFP on Monday, easing fears of another coup."I have talked to military leaders. We will allow politicians to work it out. The military will not get involved," said General Prawit Wongsuwon. "The people have spoken clearly so the military cannot do anything. We accept it."(Agencies)
