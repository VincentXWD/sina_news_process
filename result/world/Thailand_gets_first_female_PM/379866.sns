BANGKOK - Thailand's outgoing defence minister and former army chief said on Monday the country's powerful military had accepted the opposition party's election win and would not try to prevent it from forming a government."I can assure that the military has no desire to stray out of its assigned roles," Prawit Wongsuwan, who is close to the military leadership, told Reuters."The army accepts the election results, and I can say clearly that we have never entertained any idea of doing anything that will damage the country."(Agencies)
