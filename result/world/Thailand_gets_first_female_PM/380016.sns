BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commissioner Prapun Naigowit said on Tuesday the Election Commission (EC) expects to endorse the July 3 election results on July 12 if no more complaints about electoral frauds are made.According to the EC, vote counting is expected to be completed Tuesday and an official announcement of the results will be made right after, therefore, the EC is likely to be able to certify the result next Tuesday.Regarding the overall situation of the election day, Prapun indicated that Thai people were very alert to the recent polling as the voter turnout almost hit 75 percent, higher than that of 2007.Prapun said the EC is trying to finish probe into complaints pertaining to electoral frauds filed so far within 30 days after the election date.The Commissioner noted that if investigations could not be finished within 30 days, the EC would testify candidates under the probe but could still withdraw their status later if clear evidence of law violations were found.A re-election in the constituency where the Member of Parliament candidate is given a red card will be arranged.
