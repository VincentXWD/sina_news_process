BANGKOK - Thailand's state Election Commission has dashed chances of a quick transition to a new government.The commission failed to certify the victories of more than one-quarter of the winning candidates in the July 3 polls.The commission announced late Tuesday that those it was not ready to endorse include Yingluck Shinawatra, who was set to become prime minister after her Pheu Thai party won 265 seats in the 500-seat lower house of parliament. Yingluck is the youngest sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, deposed as prime minister by a 2006 military coup.The commission, which can disqualify winners, will investigate further whether the 142 candidates it did not endorse had violated election law. It did not specify reasons for it rulings.(Agencies)
