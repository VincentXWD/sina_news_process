BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's outgoing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and the Prime Minister in-waiting Yingluck Shinawatra on Thursday asked the members of "Red Shirt" movement not to put pressure on the Election Commission (EC) to endorse all elected Pheu Thai MPs.The caretaker premier Abhisit said Thursday morning that leaders of the Red Shirt, or the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), should stop putting pressure on the Election Commission (EC).Abhisit was referring to Red Shirt's remark on Wednesday that they may rally against the EC if the agency fails to endorse all Pheu Thai election winners within the 30-day time frame.Meanwhile, the incoming PM Yingluck Shinawatra also asked the UDD leaders not to put pressure on the EC.The EC should be allowed to work freely without pressure, she said. She also expressed confidence over the agency that it will ensure justice.Until now the EC has not yet endorsed 12 Red Shirt members who are on Pheu Thai party-list as some complaints were filed against them earlier.Pheu Thai won a majority in the election earlier this month, sweeping 265 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, while the Democrats won only 159.
