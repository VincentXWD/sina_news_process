Lena Dunham, director, writer and creator of HBO's hit series "Girls," knows a thing or two about women. In her latest ad for President Barack Obama, Dunham speaks to young female voters about making their "first time" count.Some conservatives, however, are offended by the double entendre.Dunham's Obama ad, appropriately titled "Lena Dunham: Your First Time," debuted on the official BarackObamadotcom YouTube channel on Thursday. In the ad, the "Girls" actress talks about her first time."Your first time shouldn't be with just anybody, you wanna do it with a great guy," says Dunham. "It should be with a guy with beautiful... Someone who really cares about and understands woman." Later joking, "It's also super uncool to be out and about and someone says, 'Did you vote?' and you say, 'No, I wasn't ready.'"Alas, she is not talking about sex, but voting. "My first time voting was amazing," she says. "It was this line in the sand. Before I was a girl, now I was a woman."Dunham tweeted to her followers, "My first time was with @BarackObama â€“ I highly recommend you do the same."
