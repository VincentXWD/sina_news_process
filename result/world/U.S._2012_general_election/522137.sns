Â Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's 2011 Christmas card features the whole family, including the former Massachusetts governor's children and grandchildren.Twenty-eight members of the Romney clan are shown decked out in matching outfits, with the boys in blue gingham shirts and the girls in orange polka-dotted dresses. Romney sits proudly at the front of the photo next to his wife Ann, one of his granddaughters propped up on his knee.
