Bronco Bama girl is the 4-year-old Colorado girl who softened the hearts of Americans this week by bursting into tears over a public radio report on the endless news coverage of the 2012 presidential election; "I'm tired of Bronco Bama and Mitt Romney," says little Abigael Evans.Bronco Bama girl was issued a formal apology from NPR after she burst into tears – exhausted tears – over yet another report on the 2012 presidential elections."Viewer Elizabeth Evans said she and her daughter, Abigael, were listening to NPR on a trip to the grocery store when Abigael started tearing up," reported Denver's 9News, in Colorado.In response, NPR issued an apology on their breaking news blog on Wednesday. "On behalf of NPR and all other news outlets, we apologize to Abigael and all the many others who probably feel like her. We must confess, the campaign's gone on long enough for us, too. Let's just keep telling ourselves: 'Only a few more days, only a few more days, only a few more days'."Many Americans share the sentiment and send a big hug to Abigael for expressing what so many are feeling all over the country.
