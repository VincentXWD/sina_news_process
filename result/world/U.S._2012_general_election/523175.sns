Republican nominee Mitt Romney pounced on an overenthusiastic remark from President Barack Obama, urging a large crowd of supporters to vote for “love of country” on Tuesday.The former Massachusetts governor said he took offense at a jab from Obama made Friday in Springfield, Ohio.After the crowd had booed at the mention of Romney’s name, Obama declared, “Vote. Voting is the best revenge.”The Romney camp wasted no time capitalizing on what it viewed as Obama not acting very presidential.They put on the air a new ad on the comment, and Romney started a four-event, three-state swing at the Portsmouth International Tradeport on Saturday with a slam at the president about it.“Yesterday, the president said something you may have heard by now that I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said, ‘You know, voting is the best revenge", Romney began.“He told his supporters, ‘Vote for revenge.’ Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I’d like to tell you: Vote for love of country.“It is time we lead America to a better place.”The Obama campaign said the president’s comment was in the context of Romney’s “scare tactics” frightening voters in Ohio that they weren’t going to have a job if they didn’t throw Obama out of office.“The message he was sending is if you don’t like the policies, if you don’t like the plan that Gov. Romney is putting forward, if you think that’s a bad deal for the middle class, then you can go to the voting booth and cast your ballot. It’s nothing more complicated than that,” said Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki.(Agencies)
