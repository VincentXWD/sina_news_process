LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- As soon as the breaking news of incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama winning re-election is beamed from a couple of giant flat-screen television sets hung from the walls at an eatery in Alhambra near Los Angeles, supporters burst into a wild applause and cheers."What a victory!" said Kevin, who had sit in the restaurant following the voting. He clapped hands with Grace, a woman in her thirties."He wins!" was Grace's first word she uttered when she was glued by the scene where CNN anchors announced Obama's victory against his Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The pair then embraced in excitement.A group of some 100 Americans gathered at the Brazilian eatery and watched the television about the latest development on the tight race between Obama and Romney, while sipping wines and exchanging their views and expectations over the event which comes every four years.Judy Chu, the Democratic Representative who hails from El Monte in San Gabriel Valley in eastern Los Angeles, joined the crowd in the small and dark-lit restaurant."I am so excited because when I went to Ohio, I helped to rally for him (President Obama) with the Asian and Pacific Islander population," Chu said when sharing her reaction toward Obama's re-election victory and her role in the campaign.In reaction to Obama's win, Chu also promised to boost the economy in the San Gabriel Valley by providing assistance to the small businesses operating in the area. "I want to work to make sure that we get more mass transit into the area, the Gold Line," she said.Chu, a politician of Chinese descent, also said she would realize the goal of the U.S. becoming the leader of the world in college graduation rate by the year 2020, "as President Obama is promising to do."According to the state Registrar's Office, 4,674,338 voters in the Los Angeles County had registered to cast their votes before Tuesday. This number was 8.7 percent more than in the 2008 presidential election when 4,298,440 people made their choices."I voted because I want a change," a woman who came out from a voting booth in El Monte told Xinhua. "If I don't vote, I can't complain."Ringo H.W. Chiu, a photojournalist and also an Obama supporter, casted his vote last week ahead of the vote day."Obama has been the president during the past three and half years," he said. "It makes sense to give him four more years to realize his goal."According to Chiu, many of his friends who are mostly voters of Chinese descent have voted for Obama, a president who hails from an ethnically minority background. They feel close to the incumbent head of the state, Chiu said.For Bessie Wang, a Chinese immigrant, every vote counts."There are more and more Chinese voters these years, including myself," she said. "We realize that every vote counts and relates to our living situation. So we must come and vote."The voting, however, was also marred by sporadic problems. Some residents in Hancock Park, an affluent neighborhood in Los Angeles, complained about not being notified about a polling place being moved from a spot near Third Street and Wilton Place to the Wilshire United Methodist Church, a few blocks away at 4350 Wilshire Blvd.Voters waited for more than an hour as no voting machines were put into place at Trinity Street School in South Los Angeles before leaving in frustration.Some voters were being asked for identification before being allowed to cast their vote, which is not required in California, according to media reports.
