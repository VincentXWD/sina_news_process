As follows from a statement by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), “the general elections in the United States took place in a highly competitive and pluralistic environment, and were administered in a professional manner, but steps should be taken to address specific concerns”.Ambassador Daan Everts, the Head of the OSCE/ODIHR Limited Election Observation Mission said: “There are real concerns over issues such as voting rights, the accuracy of voter lists, the transparency of campaign finance, recount procedures and access for international election observers.”The statement, posted on the OSCE’s web-site, goes further and notes that “the legal framework for general elections is highly decentralized and complex, as the implementation and details of the process are regulated by state laws”.A particular stress was laid upon the fact that an estimated 50 million eligible citizens were not able to cast ballots as they were not registered.
