Romney blames loss on Obama's gift giving to voters

Mitt Romney, in his first remarks since an unexpectedly lopsided election loss to Barack Obama, blamed his defeat Wednesday on "gifts" showered by the president on his female, African-American and Hispanic supporters.A little more than a week after the election, Romney in a phone call with his national finance committee accused Obama of following the "old playbook" by bestowing favors on key Democratic constituencies in exchange for their support at the ballot box."In each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups," said the defeated Republican presidential nominee, adding that young voters were also among the beneficiaries of Obama's largesse."With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest, was a big gift," Romney said.Obama garnered 51 percent of the popular vote, while Romney got 48 percent.The president's win was more decisive in the Electoral College, where he earned 332 votes against Romney's 206.Romney told the donors on Wednesday's conference call that Obama "made a big effort on small things," while his own campaign had been about "big issues."Among the goodies Romney said Obama gave to his backers were "free contraceptives," which were very big with young college-aged women.The president's controversial health care reform plan was another campaign plum that helped secure the youth vote, Romney said."Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents' plan, and that was a big gift to young people," Romney told his backers."They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008," he said.But in addition to young voters, minorities rallied around Obama, with 93 percent of African Americans, 71 percent of Hispanics and 72 percent of Asians casting a ballot for the president.Romney said the perquisites on offer were particularly tempting to low-income voters."You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you're now going to get free health care -- particularly if you don't have it -- getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity," Romney said. "I mean, this is huge."(Agencies)
