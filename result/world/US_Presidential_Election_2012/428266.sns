DES MOINES, the United States, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iowa caucuses on Tuesday night will formally kick off the 2012 U.S. presidential election.The following is a series of events leading up to the national poll on Nov. 6.The whole process roughly started in early 2011, and potential candidates began to form exploratory committees last May. Since President Barack Obama is running unopposed in the Democratic Party, the GOP race attracted most media attention before the primary.According to Allan Lichtman, a history professor from American University, the fierceness of competition among Republican candidates was rarely seen before."It' s like the rise and the fall of the Roman Empire in miniature and time-compressed." said Lichtman, noting he had "never seen so many candidates rise and equally, rapidly fall."After a series of debates and extensive campaigning, the Republican and Democratic parties enter the nomination contest in 2012, and both parties will determine their candidates for presidency based on a series of state-by-state primary elections, including caucuses and primaries.The Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary are the first two major events in the nomination process, serving as early indicators on who might get nominated.After the early voting states, the next big event is the so-called "Super Tuesday" of March 6 when primary elections will be held in 11 states and Virgin Islands.A clear winner could emerge by that time, and a prolonged nomination war could also drag the candidates into summer, as other primary elections are scheduled through June, including populous states such as California.The two parties will each hold a convention by the end of the summer, formally announcing respective candidates for president and vice president and their policy platforms.On Nov. 6, all 50 states and the District of Columbia will hold elections to select members of the Electoral College and the winner of the 2012 U.S. presidential race will emerge that night.
