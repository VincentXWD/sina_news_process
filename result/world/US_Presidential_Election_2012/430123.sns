Five things to watch in New Hampshire primary

by Xinhua Writers Du Jing, Sun HaoMANCHESTER, the United States, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A week after the Iowa caucuses which ended up in a virtual tie at the top between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, U.S. Republican presidential hopefuls kick off their second contest in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Here are five things to watch in the first-in-the-nation primary.No. 1: Will Romney win beautifully?After winning by the skin of his teeth in Iowa, Romney is the favorite to win handily in New Hampshire."It will be a stunning blow to his campaign if he doesn't win New Hampshire," William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Xinhua. "The only question is the margin."Romney views New Hampshire as his impregnable fortress. He has invested a lot more time in the state than he ever did in Iowa. It will be difficult for any of his opponents to beat him in what's considered his second home state. He was a former governor of Massachusetts which is next door to New Hampshire. And more importantly, he has been for months enjoying wide lead over the field in the Granite State in major polls.According to a Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey released Sunday, Romney is holding 35 percent of support among likely Republican voters in New Hampshire, 17 points ahead of Texas congressman Ron Paul who followed at 18 percent.Still, Romney has seen his support somewhat eroded over the past week, which came along with the surges of Paul, Jon Huntsman and, to a lesser extent, Rick Santorum.It might be seen as another ugly win, as he did in Iowa, if he ends up winning by a single-digit margin Tuesday night.No. 2: Will Santorum build on Iowa success?The former Pennsylvania senator was mostly marginalized in this campaign until two weeks into the Iowa caucuses, in which he came in second with just eight votes short of Romney.Riding the momentum, Santorum has seen his poll numbers rising in some key battlegrounds like New Hampshire and South Carolina. He is considered one of the candidates that could potentially coalesce the conservative votes -- now fragmented among several candidates -- to pose a real challenge to Romney.But it would be difficult for Santorum to turn New Hampshire into another Iowa given the demographic difference of the two states.The Republican party in Iowa is dominated by evangelicals and social conservatives, so that Santorum's extremely conservative message on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues worked well there. New Hampshire is more secular and less conservative, with economy and jobs topping people's concerns."It's harder to have social conservatives to do well in New Hampshire, and they have never done well there," said Galston of the Brookings Institution. "I don't expect Santorum to break that."Santorum ranks fifth in the PPP survey with 11 percent of the votes, essentially tied with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who is at 12 percent.No. 3: Will Huntsman be New Hampshire's Santorum?Like Santorum, the former Utah governor failed to gain traction for most of the past year. He skipped Iowa and staked his campaign entirely on a good showing in New Hampshire to stay alive.With 16 percent of support, Huntsman ranks third in the PPP New Hampshire survey, much higher than his low-single-digit showing in national polls.His moderate position on social issues including his support for civil unions works well in New Hampshire, where same-sex marriage is legal.But even with a top-three finish on Tuesday night, Huntsman's White House bid is still considered a long shot. He has weak campaign organizations beyond New Hampshire and his moderate message would be hard to sell to a GOP electorate more conservative than before.No. 4: Will Paul upset New Hampshire with independents, young voters?The 76-year-old Texan has become somewhat of a political rockstar. He runs strong among independents and young voters who share his anti-government and isolationist views.In the Iowa caucuses, Paul received 44 percent of the vote among independents, and 48 percent of voters aging under 30.The large amount of independents in New Hampshire, which account for more than 40 percent of the total electorate, would be an important asset for the libertarian-leaning candidate.Paul's son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, predicted Monday that his father could emerge victorious in Tuesday's primary if there is a sizable independent showing."I think there's a remote chance we could pull an upset here if there is a large independent turnout -- if all of a sudden, in the last two days, independents said, 'We want to send a message, and we want to get out and vote,'" he said on the campaign trail in New Hampshire.No. 5: Who's next to quit?The New Hampshire primary, along with the Iowa caucuses, is not only a place for candidates to test the water of the presidential election but also to winnow the field.Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann dropped out of the race after a poor showing in Iowa, where she was a favorite last summer.A weak showing in Iowa also made Rick Perry to reassess his candidacy, though he backed away hours later to indicate he would press ahead into South Carolina.So is there anyone to quit after the New Hampshire primary? Some analysts said Huntsman might do so if he falls out of the top three.A candidate's dropping out might have important implications for the rest of the field. For instance, Bachmann's quit would benefit Santorum most, as the two candidates were competing for the same pool of GOP voters -- evangelicals and social conservatives.
