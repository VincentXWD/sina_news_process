WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama will formally launch his re-election bid next week by holding his first official campaign rallies in two swing states of Ohio and Virginia, his campaign said on Wednesday.Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will travel to Ohio State University in Columbus and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond on May 5 to attend the rallies, as it has become clear that leading Republican contender Mitt Romney is sure to secure his nomination after sweeping the primaries in five states on Tuesday.The president has been trying hard to woo young voters as he is on a tour of three university campuses in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa this week to urge Congress to extend a law to prevent the student loan interest rates from doubling.Obama won the states of Ohio and Virginia in the presidential elections in 2008, and he tries to repeat his victory in the two swing states amid the November re-election.While the White House insists that Obama's visits to the campuses in the swing states are "official business," the Republican campaign has criticized him for being in a campaign mode.The Republican National Committee has filed a formal complaint with the Government Accountability Office requesting an investigation into whether the president has used taxpayer money to fund his trips.
