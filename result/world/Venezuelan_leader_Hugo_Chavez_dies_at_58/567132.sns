Venezuela's ailing President Hugo Chavez is undergoing chemotherapy in the capital's military hospital, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Friday, calling for respect for Chavez and his family."The president is carrying out new complementary therapies, and chemotherapy," he said after inaugurating a new "hope" chapel within the military hospital complex to pray for Chavez's recovery.Chavez is still in good spirits and is battling for his health, Maduro said without mentioning when or whether the president would return to health.Since the beginning of his illness, Chavez has been clear with the people and never lied, said the vice president, adding that, "In December, we discovered that the disease had relapsed, the president talked to his people and told the truth."Maduro called on the Venezuelans to continue praying for Chavez and to defeat the plots trying to create chaos and destabilize the country.The 58-year-old Chavez has been in power for 14 years. Last October, he was re-elected to a third six-year term, but could not be sworn in as scheduled on Jan. 10 due to his serious health problems.After seeking medical treatment for 70 days in Cuba, he came back to his country late last month.Yet he has been unable to appear before the public since then except in a number of pictures disclosed by the government which were taken in Cuba, showing that he was lying in bed in the company of his two daughters.
