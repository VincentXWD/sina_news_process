Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday that President Hugo Chavez is taking his time to recover and there are decisions that only he could evaluate and make."He is taking his time, but as in all stages, there are vital decisions that only he could evaluate and make," Maduro said during an official ceremony, showing a folder containing documents corrected by Chavez."The president has requested a series of documents. We send him this core document that already contains a series of guidelines that came in last Friday's meeting," he said.Maduro said Chavez's recovery process has been "totally different" to other operations, because the surgery on Dec. 11 in Havana was "more sensitive."Earlier in the day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua appealed to the public to let Chavez remain "quiet" while receiving cancer treatments, a day after the government confirmed that the president is undergoing chemotherapy."Those who want to see Chavez recovered and healthy should keep quiet, "said Jaua in a ceremony in Caracas.The 58-year-old Chavez has been in power for 14 years. Last October, he was re-elected to a third six-year term, but could not be able to swear in as scheduled on Jan. 10 due to serious health problems.According to official information, Chavez suffered a severe respiratory infection after the six-hour operation he had in Cuba late last year. His cancer was first detected in his pelvic region in June 2011, yet no one in the Chavez administration has ever confirmed what exact type of cancer the president suffers from.After seeking medical treatment for 70 days in Cuba, he came back to his country late last month. Yet he has been unable to appear before the public since then except in a number of pictures disclosed by the government which were taken in Cuba, showing that he was lying in bed in the company of his two daughters.The Venezuelan opposition has called for the president to appear or resign, if he could not continue to rule. The government, which insists that Chavez is still in charge, accuses the opposition of spreading rumors and trying to "destabilize" the country.
