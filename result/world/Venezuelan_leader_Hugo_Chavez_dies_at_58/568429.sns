A tearful Hugo Chavez has prayed for God to spare his life as he attended a pre-Easter mass on returning from cancer treatment in Cuba, April, 2012.The Venezuelan president wept in a televised speech from the Catholic service in his home state of Barinas. His voice broke as he eulogized Jesus, the revolutionary fighter Che Guevara and the South American independence hero Simon Bolívar."Give me your crown, Jesus. Give me your cross, your thorns so that I may bleed. But give me life, because I have more to do for this country and these people. Do not take me yet," Chavez said, standing below an image of Jesus with the Crucifix.Chavez said he had held faith that his cancer would not return after his first two operations last year – which removed a baseball sized tumor from his pelvis – but it did."Today I have more faith than yesterday," he said. "Life has been a hurricane ... but a couple of years ago my life began to become not my own any more. Who said the path of revolution would be easy?"(Agencies)
