MINSK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will attend the funeral of Venezuelan late President Hugo Chavez in Caracas, the presidential press service said on Thursday.Lukashenko decided personally to take part in the mourning ceremonies in Caracas taking into account the friendly nature and strategic level of Belarusian-Venezuelan relations, the press service said."This is due to the fact that Hugo Chavez didn't have such close relations with any other foreign leader as he did with the Belarusian president. Thanks to the friendship of the two leaders, our countries managed to achieve impressive results in developing ties in all spheres in a relatively short period," the press office said.Belarusian flags were flown at half-mast at the Presidential Palace and other government buildings for three days in line with the decision of Lukashenko. All TV and radio channels have been recommended not to broadcast entertainment programs.
