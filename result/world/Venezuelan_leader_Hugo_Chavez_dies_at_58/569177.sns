HAVANA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Cubans led by their leader Raul Castro Thursday paid special homage to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a staunch Cuban ally who spent much of his final months in Havana for cancer treatment, Cuban television reported.Cubans gathered since the early hours of the day at town squares throughout the island in what was the second day of a three-day mourning period declared by authorities.In Havana, Cuba's newly-named First Vice President and likely successor to Castro, Miguel Diaz-Canel, led the ceremony at Revolution Square.Castro, 81, presided over the ceremony in Cuba's second-largest city Santiago de Cuba, accompanied by the First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Santiago, Lazaro Exposito.At the town's central Revolution Plaza, Castro placed a white rose before an image of a smiling Chavez, who lost his battle with cancer Tuesday at Caracas' Military Hospital at the age of 58.Afterwards, residents solemnly filed past his memorial, as Cuban television broadcast the ceremonies live.In an official statement, the government said news of Chavez's passing was received with "profound and searing pain" and pledged Cuba's "eternal loyalty" to Chavez's memory and legacy.Cuba will preserve his "ideals of unifying revolutionary forces, and the integration and independence of Latin America," the government said.The day-long ceremonies were to last from 8 am to 8 pm.In Venezuela's capital Caracas Thursday, hundreds of thousands filed past Chavez's casket to pay their final respects, some after having waited up to nine hours, Venezuelan media said.Chavez's funeral is to be held Friday, when Cuba plans a 21-gun salute at Havana's famed San Carlos de la Cabana Fort. Cuban officials, however, have yet to say who will be representing them Friday at the funeral.Leaders from around Latin America will be attending the funeral, and several are already there, including the presidents of Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay.Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff and her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva left Thursday for Caracas, to attend the funeral. The Brazilian delegation also includes Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota, Bahia state governor Jacques Wagner, and other prominent politicians from the leftist party.In a statement issued late Tuesday, Rousseff expressed her condolences and said Chavez had brought Venezuela and Brazil closer "than ever before in history.""Hugo Chavez will live on in the memory of Venezuelans, Brazilians and Latin Americans, and will forever serve as a model for all Latin America," Rousseff added.In an editorial published Thursday in a major U.S. daily, Brazil's ex-President Lula da Silva, a personal friend of Chavez, writes "history will affirm, justifiably, the role Hugo Chavez played in the integration of Latin America, and the significance of his 14-year presidency to the poor people of Venezuela."Chavez was "a strong, dynamic and unforgettable figure whose ideas will be discussed for decades in universities, labor unions, political parties and anyplace people are concerned with social justice," Lula da Silva added.
