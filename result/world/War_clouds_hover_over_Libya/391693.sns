TRIPOLI, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Libyan rebels announced late Thursday to transfer their leadership from Benghazi to the capital Tripoli.Doha-based TV channel Al-Jazeera quoted the announcement by a senior official of the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) at a press conference as saying that the NTC has transferred its executive committee's work to Tripoli.The official said Tripoli will remain the capital of Libya, calling on the police to resume work and restore order in the city.The official paid tribute to "the martyrs" in the rebels' fighting with forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and expressed appreciation for the support offered by countries such as Britain and Qatar.The NTC will not revenge on Gaddafi loyalists, but must put Gaddafi to justice, the official said.The rebels entered the capital earlier this week and overran Gaddafi's military compound Tuesday after a day of fierce fighting. They claimed that they have controlled 90 percent of Tripoli, but intense fighting was still going on in many parts of the city between the rebels and Gaddafi's loyalists.
