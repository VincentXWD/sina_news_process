The spokesman said French special envoy to NTC Antoine Sivan would be in Tripoli when the NTC leadership moves to the capital.In February, Paris closed its embassy in Libya and recalled all of its diplomatic staff, citing deteriorating security situation.France initiated the NATO-led air strikes on Gaddafi's troops in March, and was the first world power to recognize the NTC as legal representative of Libya.On Saturday, Niger recognized the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.Nigerien Foreign Minister Bazoum Mohamed said in a statement Saturday that "Niger still believes in the principles of equal sovereignty, noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries, good neighborliness and cooperation as well as the desire for peace and stability in a friendly country. Therefore, the Nigerien government had acknowledged the regime change that happened in Libya which made the NTC the only legitimate representative of the Libyan people."Meanwhile, Niger asked the warring sides to put down their weapons to promote peace and preserve the country's unity and social cohesion.The Nigerien government further appealed to the international community to effectively contribute to restoration of peace and stability in the country besides helping to resolve the current humanitarian crisis.It also asked NTC to guarantee the security and the well- being of foreigners living in Libya.Libya and Niger have had close relations in sectors such as commerce, tourism, security, culture, communication, training, road infrastructure and transport.
