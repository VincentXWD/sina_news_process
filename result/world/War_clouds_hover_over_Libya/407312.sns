JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- South African president Jacob Zuma on Friday criticized the slaying of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.According to the South African Press Association (SAPA), Zuma said in Pretoria that instead of being killed, Gaddafi should have been captured and tried at the International Court of Justice.Addressing a joint media briefing with visiting Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Zuma said: "I understand there was war in Libya. In a war situation, people die, people are captured."However, he said South African expected Gaddafi to be captured, given that everybody knew there was a warrant of arrest issued against him.The South African president said it is difficult at this time to pass a clear judgment, as there have been conflicting reports on what led to the killing of Gaddafi on Oct. 20.Equatorial Guinea's Mbasogo, African Union (AU) chairman, said the AU led several efforts "to persuade Colonel Gaddafi to cease power peacefully, but he refused".Zuma undertook two trips to Libya in 2011, on behalf of a high- level AU ad hoc committee, to try to help find a solution in Libya.
