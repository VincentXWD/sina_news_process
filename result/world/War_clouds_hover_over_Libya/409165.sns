BERLIN, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO will wrap up its operations in Libya on October 31, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said here on Thursday.Addressing a press conference after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Rasmussen said he did not expect the alliance to play "a major role" in Libya's post-conflict period."If requested we can assist the new Libyan government in the transformation to democracy, for instance with defense and security sector reform, but I wouldn't expect new tasks beyond that," he said.NATO would make a formal decision on ending the Libya mission when its decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, meets Friday in Brussels, Rasmussen added.Also on Thursday, the U.N. Security Council decided to end its authorization of a no-fly zone over Libya and the protection of civilians on Oct. 31, despite a call by Libya's National Transitional Council for a delay.
