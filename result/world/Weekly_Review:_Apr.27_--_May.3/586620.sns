This may not seem out of place in a country in which you can play video games on a toilet and the national tourism ambassador is... Hello Kitty, but Japan has a crying baby competition, and it's a little weird.The "Naki Sumo," contest consists of two sumo wrestlers holding up children who were born in the previous year, standing across a sumo wrestling ring from each other and trying to make their opponent's baby cry.The event, which has been held annually for over 400 years, is meant as a prayer for the children's healthy growth.(Agencies)
