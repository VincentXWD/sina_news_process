MADRID, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid coach, Jose Mourinho this Tuesday appeared to confirm that he will be leaving Real Madrid at the end of the current season.Speaking on British television station, ITV, after the Champions League semi-final which his side won 2-0 at home to Borussia Dortmund, which was not enough to overcome their first leg defeat 4-1, the Real Madrid coach was asked whether he hoped to do better at Real Madrid next season. "Maybe not .. I don't know, but I know I want to be where I love to be, where people love me to be .." he replied.Incredibly the TV station cut him off before he could say any more, but in his press conference after the game, Mourinho added, "The most important thing is not that I am here or not, it is what Real Madrid do. Real Madrid have won European Cups in different periods - first of all the first six European Cups and then the seventh, eighth and ninth. Now we have played three semi- finals and we have recovered our credibility, but Real Madrid doesn't live by 'almosts' and neither do I. These have been three economically fantastic years for the club. They have won a long of money and they have not had to pay incentives.""They have to win it (The Champions League) in the future, when they will win it, I don't know and it would be optimum if they win it with me, but if not, I will celebrate the same."He also commented that a lot of people hate him in Spain, which makes it highly likely that he will leave for England, probably to coach Chelsea once again, at the end of the season, despite having a contract with Real Madrid until 2016.
