A Pakistani court moved Tuesday to ban former military ruler Pervez Musharraf from contesting elections for the rest of his life, a step which his aides immediately vowed to challenge.The retired general has been humiliated since returning last month from self-imposed exile to contest elections and is currently under house arrest.He will spend the May 11 general elections under lock and key, after an anti-terrorism court in the garrison city of Rawalpindi put him under house arrest for 14 days over the death of politician Benazir Bhutto in 2007.Just hours later, a court in the northwestern city of Peshawar dismissed an appeal against his disqualification from standing for election in the district of Chitral and banned him for life from running for parliament, lawyers said.The ban extended to the lower and upper houses of the federal parliament and to all provincial assemblies, lawyer Mohibullah Tarichvi told AFP.A spokesman for Musharraf's All Pakistan Muslim League party, Muhammad Amjad, was circumspect."We can challenge it," he told AFP.A court in the eastern city of Lahore is scheduled to rule May 7 on separate appeals against his disqualification for the current election in other seats. He applied to stand in a total of four constituencies."If the court upholds the disqualification then we will go to the Supreme Court," Amjad said.Musharraf had promised to "save" the country from militancy and economic collapse but was barred from running as a candidate over charges dating back to his 1999-2008 rule.He will now spend polling day in his Islamabad villa, which has been designated as a jail, making his chances of even voting remote.Musharraf's lawyer Ibrahim Satti told AFP that his client could request a postal vote but said a government-facilitated visit to a polling station would be unlikely "because of security concerns".The retired general is also under house arrest for sacking judges when he imposed emergency rule in 2007.Musharraf is accused of conspiracy to murder former prime minister Bhutto, whose Pakistan People's Party was elected into power in 2008 on a wave of sympathy over her death in a gun and suicide attack.Besides the sacking of judges, he faces a third legal case over the 2006 death of a Baluch rebel leader and has been threatened with death by the Taliban.Nobody has ever been convicted or jailed for Bhutto's assassination. Musharraf's government blamed the killing on Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud, who denied any involvement and was killed in a US drone attack in 2009.But Bhutto's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is PPP chairman, has accused Musharraf of her murder.In 2010 a UN report said Bhutto's death could have been prevented and accused Musharraf's government of failing to give her adequate protection.Agencies
