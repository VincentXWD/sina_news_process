Bayern win 3-0 in Camp Nou to cruise into Champions League final

There were no surprises and no miracle fightback in FC Barcelona's  Camp Nou Stadium this Wednesday night as Bayern Munich won 3-0 on the  night to qualify 7- 0 on aggregate for the final of the Champions  League, where they will take on fellow countrymen, Borussia Dortmund at  Wembley.If Borussia had to suffer a difficult last 10 minutes against Real  Madrid on Tuesday night before assuring their place in the final, an  impressive Bayern reached their third final in four years without really  suffering, despite a spirit performance, at least in the first half  from Barca.Arjen Robben's goal at the start of the second half made it 1- 0 on  the night to the Germans and 5-0 on aggregate and Gerard Pique's own  goal merely underlined the obvious: that Bayern were the better team.The big pre-game surprise was that Leo Messi, who many had seen as  Barca's one and only hope of working a Champions League miracle, was on  the subs' bench as a result of his hamstring problem.Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets were also missing, while Bayern were without central defender Dante, who had flu.Barca coach Tito Vilanova had promised that his side would be true to  themselves and play the football that had eluded them and with a Bayern  side that had clearly not come to defend their 4-0 advantage from the  first leg, the first half was a vibrant open affair with both sides  looking to take the game to their rivals.Barcelona looked to Xavi and Andres Iniesta to be their inspiration,  while Bayern based their play on the impressive midfield duo of Bastian  Schweinsteiger and Javi Martinez, who despite the importance of the game  did not commit one single foul in the opening 45 minutes. Also to their  credit Bayern looked to keep the ball rolling, perhaps because their  supreme confidence told them they had no need to try and resort to time  wasting tactics.Despite the high-energy football, it did not produce and goals, with  the best chances being a volley from Xavi Hernandez which flew over the  Bayern bar and a couple of breaks through Arjen Robben, who saw his  chances blocked by last ditch tackles from Gerard Pique and Alex Song,  who was enjoying a good game in place of Busquets.The tie was over as a contest three minutes into the second half when  Robben scored for the visitors. Victor Valdes sliced a long clearance  from his area and a long pass from David Alaba found Robben in space to  cut in from the right and curl a left foot shot into the far corner of  the Barca net.The away goal meant Barca had to score six goals in just over 40  minutes and the only voices heard in the Camp Nou were those of the over  5,000 Bayern fans who had made the trip from Munich.Vilanova soon took off Xavi and Iniesta, perhaps mindful that his  side can take the consolation prize of the Primera Liga this Sunday  night, but although domestic success awaits Barca, as Pique' s 72nd own  goal highlighted, it is Bayern who will have a chance at European glory.Thomas Muller made it 3-0 on the night with 13 minutes left, but by then the goal was almost an anecdote.
