China's Ding Junhui suffered a shock defeat 13-7 to Barry Hawkins at the quarterfinals of the World Snooker championship here on Wednesday.Hawkins, who stunned world No. 1 Mark Selby in the second round, will next take on Ricky Walden or Michael White for a place in the final.Ding, ranked ninth in the world, trailed Hawkins 3-5 in the first session and 7-9 in the second Tuesday night. He struggled in the third and made errors constantly while he 14th-ranked Hawkins took command and wasted no chances. ( "It's unbelievable," Hawkins said. "I felt pretty good. I've been trying so hard for so long just to make some kind of breakthrough and I managed to do it this year in Australia (by winning). I've been pretty consistent through most of this year but to come here and get to the one table set-up is like a dream come true."Ding said: "I don't like morning sessions because I can't sleep properly the night before. Sometimes something bad that's happened keeps battering away in your mind so you can't sleep."Some players get help from experienced players but I haven't got anyone to help me so I have to do everything myself. I like to listen to people who will tell me if I'm doing something bad, that would be a big help for me."Barry took his chances and made big breaks and every frame his safety was good. Mine wasn't as good because I left him a lot of chances to take. Sometimes you need to be very strong but that's what experience will do for me. I need to learn what to do in each session."
