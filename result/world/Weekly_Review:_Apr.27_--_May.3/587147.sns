By Jia Xiaoguang, Sina EnglishA centenarian has come under fire for his remarkably large donation to the quake-stricken areas in Lushan, southwestern Sichuan Province through the Red Cross China, which is questioned as fraud charity and a hype for the recently beleaguered philanthropic organization.Guan Yinghan, a senior citizen from Shenyang, capital of NE China’s Liaoning Province, has reportedly donated all his “life’s savings” to the quake-hit Lushan.His charitable deed however solicits divided opinions among the Internet users. Some laud him as “the most kind-hearted grandpa”, while others associate him with a propagandist hired to win back the reputation for the Chinese Red Cross wilting under series of alleged corruption scandals of late.“I have donated on eight different occasions in total, and every time I gave out all my savings in hand.” said Guan during a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency.“The 103 thousand yuan of donation to the quake-hit areas is an aggregate of the savings plus the interests I have accumulated since a donation of 70.4 thousand yuan to the local Red Cross three years ago.” he added.One staff member of the local Red Cross clarified that the agency has never briefed any media about Guan’s “donation of life’s savings”, nor utilized it as a publicity stunt.“The fact might have been distorted when the report was disseminated on the Internet.” said the staff member surnamed Hou.
