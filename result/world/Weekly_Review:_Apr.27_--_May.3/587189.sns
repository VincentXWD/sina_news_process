James Harden lacked the energy to get through a morning shoot-around. Then he found the strength to fill the Houston Rockets with life in a playoff series that had started to look hopeless.Harden scored 31 points and sank seven 3-pointers while fighting flu-like symptoms, and the Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 107-100 Wednesday night to pull within 3-2 in their first-round playoff series.Harden made the first seven 3s he tried and Houston led by as many as 16 to win its second straight, getting halfway to becoming the first team in NBA history to overcome an 0-3 series deficit.''I just tried to go out there and give it all I had,'' said Harden, adding that he slept all day. ''It was a win or go home, so I got some shots to fall and I just tried to not think about it.''The Rockets played without starting point guard Jeremy Lin for the second straight game because of a bruised chest muscle. Key reserve Carlos Delfino didn't play in the second half because of a sore left foot.They still had plenty of offense, getting 21 points and 11 rebounds from Omer Asik and 18 points and five 3-pointers from Francisco Garcia. Patrick Beverley scored 14 and Aaron Brooks and Chandler Parsons chipped in 10 apiece.''We just came out here and played pressure-free. Go out there and just hoop, that was our mindset going into the game,'' Harden said. ''The same thing back at home: just go out there and hoop. We're an eighth seed. Nobody's expecting us to win. So just give it what we've got. Simple.''(Agencies)
