The duo wore their clothes backward as a gimmick, but they won over fans with their raps.Their first, and by far most successful song, was Jump. The hit, from their multi-platinum 1992 debut album Totally Krossed Out, featured the two trading verses and rapping the refrain, the song's title.The song was written by Dupri and was a No 1 smash in the US and globally, and one of the most popular of that year.Their success led to instant fame - they toured with Michael Jackson, appeared on TV shows, and even had their own video game.The group was never able to match the tremendous success of their first song, though they had other hits like Warm It Up, and Tonite's tha Night.Earlier this year, the group performed together to celebrate the anniversary of Dupri's label, So So Def.
