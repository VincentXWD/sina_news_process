Indian Army Chief General Bikram Singh presented to Indian Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers Thursday tougher options that India has to handle the border stand-off with China. A third flag meeting between the two sides Wednesday failed to break the deadlock, according to an Indian news agency.The agency said General Singh suggested to the Cabinet Committee on Security that if ordered, the Army can cut off the route through which supplies reach the five tents that the Chinese troops have set up near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border.The Army, he reportedly said, could also counter the “Chinese incursion” by setting up an Indian Army presence in another border area.Another option that General Singh offered, the agency said, was that the Army could resume patrolling the border, skirting the neighbor's camp though that would take the patrol very close to another Chinese camp.Despite the stand-off, India and China to hold joint military exercises in OctoberIndia and China are far from resolving a border deadlock, but the armies of the two countries are on schedule to hold joint military exercises this October in the Chengdu military region in China.NDTV that an Indian Army delegation that went to China last month was unfolding has finalized the details of the exercises. The exact dates, however, are yet to be finalized. A Chinese military delegation is expected to visit India in July when the dates for the exercises will be sealed.Generally military exercises are only held between friendly countries, and given the recent border hostilities between India and China, this move might be viewed as a surprising one.But, NDTV that the Indian government's decision to go ahead with the exercises is an attempt to keep the larger relationship with China isolated from the current impasse.The agency says that the China Study Group or CSG -- the highest policy making body in India on all issues related to China, headed by the National Security Advisor -- decided to cancel the army delegation's visit to send a strong message to China. But, after the army made a pitch that engagement with China must go on despite the stand-off, the visit was cleared.(Agencies)
