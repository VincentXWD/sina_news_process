The search was called off last night for a university student in Changsha, Hunan Province, who reportedly fell into an uncovered manhole in a torrential rain Friday night, when rescuers failed to find her after two days.More than 200 rescue personnel in Changsha have searched the sewer system, sewage water pumps and even the Xiangjiang River where storm water was drained but failed to find 21-year-old Yang Lijun."We've searched 45 manholes and some corners along the pipes," said Gong Chengping, a spokesman for the Tianxin District government of the city. "We've searched many times but didn't find her."The drainage system in the city was renovated in 1951 but it dates back to hundreds of years ago and the underground structure is very complicated."I couldn't sleep. My heart is in pain every second," said Yang's mother, Fu Shunxiu.A sudden torrential rain occurred in Changsha Friday night and flooded the Tujiachong area of the city when Yang, who went to college in Beijing and was staying at a friend's home in Changsha recently for job hunting, was on her way home with her friend.As the two were walking in single file in the floodwaters, which was 30 to 40 centimeters deep, Yang's friend who was in front, suddenly saw Yang fall into a manhole behind her and disappeared.She called the victim's family immediately.Yang left a phone message on Friday for her mother: "Mom, I'm still out playing and I'll talk to you later when I go back."The mother and daughter were about to discuss Yang's future as she was supposed to graduate in the summer, Fu said.Yang, who majored in jewelry appraising at Beijing Nationality University, had planned to participate in the civil service examination after graduation and follow in her mother's footsteps.Yang also sent her ex-boyfriend a voice message on WeChat before she disappeared. "It's so cold and I'm wet all over in the rain. It's all your fault," Yang spoke to Ding Gang.Yang and Ding remained friends after they broke up and Yang had made dinner for Ding on Friday."She's really a good girl," Ding said, choking with sobs, looking at Yang's picture on his cell phone.The cover of the manhole was believed to have been swept away by the heavy flood.It was found near a newspaper stall on Saturday.
