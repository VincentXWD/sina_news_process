A U.S. government website geared toward children under the umbrella of the Department of Education yanked a quote from late Chinese leader Mao Zedong off its page on Friday after it went viral on social media.“Our attitude towards ourselves should be ‘to be satiable in learning’ and towards others ‘to be tireless in teaching,’” read what appeared to be a somewhat mangled Mao quote on the “Kids’ Zone” webpage of the National Center for Education Statistics(NCES).Screenshots of the page were posted by Buzzfeed and Slate and quickly went viral on Twitter, particularly outraging the country's conservatives.By 3:30 p.m. Eastern time, the quote had been removed, but Slate grabbed a screenshot of the page including Mao's statement."It looks like they heard the backlash and took it down," one person remarked on Twitter.The Blaze said that Education Department officials did not return calls seeking comment.The NCES describes itself as "the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations.”(Agencies)
