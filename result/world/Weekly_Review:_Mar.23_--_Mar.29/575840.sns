Japan's education ministry said Tuesday most new textbooks newly approved for use at high schools from April next year describe the disputed Diaoyu Islands as Japanese territory, according to Japanese media reports.The two geography textbooks and six of seven textbooks for politics and economics for use at Japanese high schools contained such descriptions for the Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea.The description is in line with the Japanese government's position.China immediately reacted to the outcome of the textbook screenings.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei repeated China's sovereignty claim over the islands and said at a news conference, "We hope the Japanese side faces up to history and reality, corrects mistakes and takes concrete steps for improvement in bilateral relations."(Agencies)
