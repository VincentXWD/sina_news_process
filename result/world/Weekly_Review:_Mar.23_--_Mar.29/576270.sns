Part of the remaining Berlin Wall known as the East Side Gallery was demolished on Wednesday to make way for the building of a luxury condominium.Demolition work began at 5 a.m. local time with the presence of about 250 police, and six meters of the Wall was removed by 8 a.m., the police said, adding that demolition went on smoothly without encountering protests.The 3.6-meter-high and 1.3-km-long section of the Berlin Wall has been kept as a historical relic site and transformed into the gallery featuring paintings and graffiti of various genre by well over 100 artists from all over the world.The construction project has drawn wide criticism as tens of hundreds of people gathered near the Wall in early march to voice their opposition to the move, forcing the developer to halt the planned demolition of a 20 meters segment. However, ensuing negotiations with local authorities on possible alternative sites proved fruitless.The property developer Maik Uwe Hinkel told Bild newspaper on Wednesday that the blocks are temporarily removed to enable trucks to access the building site and would be placed to their original places once construction was complete.
