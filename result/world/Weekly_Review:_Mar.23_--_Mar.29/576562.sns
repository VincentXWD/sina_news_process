By Zhang Yujie, Sina EnglishThe number of mass affluent in China mounts to more than one million, according to the White Paper of China Mass Affluent Wealth published by Forbes China, Thursday. Among those top elites, 20% intend to move overseas, and 70% want their children to study abroad.The mass affluent, as defined by the white paper, are those Chinese middle class individuals with an investable asset ranging from one hundred thousand to one million dollars. The number of the group rises quite fast in recent years, reaching 7.94 million in 2010, and 10.26 million in 2012. Their average investable assets stand at 1.33 million dollars. It is estimated that the number could rise to 12.02 million in 2013.Most of the wealthy people were born in 1960s and 1970s, among whom 19.2% work in finance and trade industry, 11.5% in manufacturing business, and 9.0% in real-estate, the paper said.The report also reveals that those white collars pay a great deal of attention to optimal configuration of their assets, a cozy living environment and their children’s education. Unlike the extremely rich ones, 76% of the middle class are more willing to live on the Chinese mainland rather than immigrating overseas, but 70% of them do want their children to study abroad.This might explain Chinese people’s craze for school district housing in foreign countries. China's state-owned CCTV reported Tuesday that a Chinese woman bought a 650 million-dollar apartment in Manhattan of New York City at the beginning of last year so that her 2-yr-old baby girl could go to NYU in the future.
