A deputy chairman of China's top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, is under investigation for suspected "serious discipline violations," as China's new leaders tackle deep-rooted corruption.Liu Tienan, 59, who until March was also head of the energy regulatory body, the National Energy Administration, is being investigated by the Communist Party's disciplinary commission, Xinhua news agency confirmed yesterday.Allegations against Liu surfaced last December when a Beijing-based journalist accused him of improper business dealing.Luo Changping, deputy editor-in-chief of Caijing Magazine, published three online reports on December 6 last year, accusing Liu of forging his academic credentials, arranging a bank loan for a Chinese businessman and taking kickbacks, and threatening his mistress after their love went sour.On January 30, Luo said on his microblog that related departments of the central government had accepted his reports and the Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection had launched an investigation.Liu was said to have a master's degree in economics and a PhD in engineering, according to his official resume on the NDRC's website.But Luo said Liu had acquired a master's degree from Japan's Nagoya City University via his mistress when he served in the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo in the late 1990s. Luo said Liu was given an honorable certification, which meant he had studied at the university, rather than a diploma certification which is given to graduates.Luo also alleges that Liu colluded with Ni Ritao, a businessman in eastern Wenzhou City, to try to arrange a bank loan of more than US$200 million for Ni.Ni sought the loan from the Export-Import Bank of China and China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd, claiming that the money would be used for the acquisition of New Skeena, a Canadian pulp mill which he had already bought.The attempt to get loan nearly succeeded and Liu's family had reportedly received kickbacks from Ni. Luo published the HSBC bank accounts of Liu's wife Guo Jinghua and his son Liu Decheng, and said these accounts received huge remittances from Ni's company.In the third report, Luo posted a photo of Liu and his mistress surnamed Xu. Luo said Liu threatened Xu many times after they broke up.According to his resume, Liu joined the Communist Party of China in June 1976 when he was 22 and began working for the State Planning Commission, the NDRC's predecessor, in 1983.Liu served as economic counselor in the Chinese Embassy in Japan between 1996 and 1999.In March 2008, Liu was promoted to deputy director of China's top planning agency.
