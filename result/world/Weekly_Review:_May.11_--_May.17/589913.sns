The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has replaced the general who headed its armed forces ministry, in a further reshuffling of the top brass by young leader Kim Jong Un.General Jang Jong Nam was named "minister of the People's Armed Forces" by official news agency KCNA in a report, the third official to take the role since Kim Jong Un formally assumed power in DPRK just over a year ago.Jang, a relatively unknown general, was previously commander of the First Corps of the Korean People's Army.The report would appear to show that armed forces ministry chief Kim Kyok Sik, reputed to have been behind the 2010 shelling of a South Korean island that killed four people, had been replaced.The post of minister of the armed forces is considered subordinate to the Army Chief of General Staff and its head of the Political Department.Jang is one of a group of younger soldiers who are stepping up to replace men who grew up under the country's founder Kim Il Sung, South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo reported.It is not known how old Jang is.Frequent reshuffles of top army figures have triggered speculation the 30-year old Kim Jong Un may be seeking to reassert the power of the Workers' Party of Korea over the country's generals.(Agencies)
