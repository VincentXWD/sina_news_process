Beyonce's pregnancy:rumor again? 
2013-05-14 09:30:50 GMT
The Internet is currently exploding with Beyonce pregnancy rumors after a report on Monday in the New York Post revealed that the singer, who is currently in the midst of a world tour, is preggers, courtesy of "exclusive sources." Is it true? Let’s discuss.Some bloggers point to certain photos from Bey’s current “Mrs. Carter Show World Tour” for evidence. According to Vibe.com, while performing in a blue, sequined body suit Beyonce’s lower half looked bigger than usual, which the site chalks up to a possible sign she’s carrying a little sibling for daughter Blue Ivy. And that her recent ban of professional photographers from her tour, a rumored attempt to avoid the release of unflattering photos (remember the Superbowl images?), is actually to prevent people from snapping pregnancy shots.To fuel the fire even more, during Beyonce’s interview last Monday with Good Morning America, she said, “I would like more children. I think my daughter needs some company. I definitely love being a big sister” adding, “At some point, when it’s supposed to happen.”Later that night when Beyonce wore a high-waisted black, strapless Givenchy gown to the Met Gala, (pictured) pregnancy rumors swirled due to the tummy-concealing nature of the dress.For perspective, Beyonce baby rumors are nothing new. In March 2010, almost two full years before Beyonce gave birth to Blue Ivy in January 2012, Media Takeout claimed to have an “exclusive” on Bey’s pregnancy from a “rock solid source." A few months later, Beyonce responded by telling The Associated Press, "At this point, they say that I've been pregnant like eight times, so I am kind of used to it. I just hope that one day when I decide to be pregnant that people are happy for me. ... One day hopefully I will be. It's part of being a celebrity, I guess."Indeed. Just ask Khloe Kardashian, who until now, has been the focus of “Is she or isn’t she?” pregnancy speculation, a phenomenon that seemingly points to the public’s borderline obsession with seeing their favorite stars procreate. And sometimes we're not satisfied even when our celebrities are pregnant—remember in October 2011 when an obviously expecting Bey sat down during an Australian talk show and the fabric of her dress folded a weird way? People claimed she was wearing a fake baby bump to cover up for her using a surrogate (Beyonce addressed the issue saying, “That was crazy. It wasn’t hurtful, it was just crazy. “[I thought] ‘Where did they come up with this?’)Good question. It’s safe to say that as long as there will be celebrities, there will be celebrity baby rumors. But it's kind of crazy that Kim Kardashian and Kate Middleton's pregnancy aren't enough to satiate the public. Either way, only time will tell—we'll keep you posted!Agencies
