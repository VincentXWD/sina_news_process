Russia expelled a United States diplomat yesterday after saying he had been caught red-handed with disguises, special equipment and wads of cash as he tried to recruit a Russian agent to work for the Central Intelligence Agency.The announcement came at an awkward time for Washington and Moscow as they try to improve ties and bring the warring sides in Syria together for a peace conference.Russia's Federal Security Service said Ryan Fogle, a third secretary at the US Embassy in Moscow, had been detained overnight carrying "special technical equipment," a disguise, a large sum of money and instructions for recruiting his target.The Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador Michael McFaul to discuss the case today and released a statement demanding Fogle leave Russia without delay."Such provocative actions in the spirit of the Cold War will by no means promote the strengthening of mutual trust," it said.Russian television showed grainy footage of a man identified as Fogle being arrested, and the state-run Russia Today channel published photographs on its website that it said showed Fogle being detained in a blond wig.In one photograph, a man lay face-down on the ground with his arms being pinned behind his back.Another image showed two wigs, apparently found on him, as well as three pairs of glasses, a torch, a cell phone and a compass. Also displayed was a wad of 500-euro (US$650) notes and a letter addressed to a "Dear friend.""This is an advance from someone who has been highly impressed by your professionalism, and who would highly value your cooperation in the future," the letter said."We are willing to offer you US$100,000 and discuss your experience, expertise and cooperation, and payment could be significantly larger, if you are willing to answer concrete questions," it said, offering US$1 million a year for long-term cooperation plus possible bonuses for useful information.The FSB, a successor to the Soviet KGB, said Fogle worked for the CIA and had been handed over to embassy officials.It said he was trying to recruit a counterterrorism officer who specializes in the Caucasus, a region that includes Chechnya and Dagestan.The embassy declined comment. McFaul was holding a live question-and-answer session on Twitter as news of the detention was announced, but refused to take questions on the matter.Little is known about Fogle. A third secretary is the lowest diplomatic rank in the foreign service.The last major spy row was in 2010, when 10 Russian agents, including Anna Chapman, were deported in exchange for four Russians jailed for spying for the West.(Agencies)
