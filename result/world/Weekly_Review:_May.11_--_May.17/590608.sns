The inflatable duck finally “collapsed”due to several breakage causing air leakage after floating in Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong for 12 days on May 14.The 54-foot tall, bright yellow inflatable duck floating in Victoria Harbor has ignited a frenzy in the city, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors and spawning a wave of duck-related products and dishes, occasionally served with the famous visitor's feathered brethren.The duck has already shown up in nine countries, in cities from Osaka to São Paulo to Sydney. But the welcome it has triggered in Hong Kong has eclipsed them all. Residents in the city embraced the inflatable water fowl even before it arrived. Word that the duck, still deflated, had landed in Hong Kong spread on social media and crowds gathered in an industrial section of the city to watch it get pumped up.When it was time to tow the duck to its temporary home next to a waterfront shopping mall, traffic jammed nearby streets. As it was being pulled by a tugboat, the duck was serenaded for 30 minutes by the city's official police band and greeted by girls from a dance school pirouetting in orange tutus and yellow feather headdresses.
