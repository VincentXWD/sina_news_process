Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Wednesday he has never denied that Japan invaded China in the past, while indicating he will follow the 1995 statement issued by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that apologized for Japan's wartime aggression in Asia, Kyodo News reports.Abe told a parliamentary committee session that Japan "deeply regrets having inflicted great damage and suffering" on both China and the Korean Peninsula, in comments seen as an apparent move to allay concerns among Asian neighbors over his recent remarks that seemingly gloss over Japan's wartime conduct.Abe added his Cabinet has "never denied Japan's invasion or colonial occupation."(Agencies)
