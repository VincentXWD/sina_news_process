BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nobel Prize winners Chen Ning Yang and Mo Yan discussed science and literature with students in Beijing on Wednesday,encouraging them to work hard despite difficulties.The laureates shared their ideas with students from Peking University. According to Yang, 91, achievements could be made by young people in their 20s or 30s, especially in mathematics and theoretical physics, as they could be more concentrated than older people in a specific field.In 1957, 35-year-old Yang shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with his colleague Tsung Dao Lee for their joint work in upsetting the principle of conservation of parity as a fundamental law of nuclear physics.According to Mo, the 2012 Nobel laureate in literature, there is more freedom in literature than in physics and chemistry.Mo praised Yang as a genius while admitting he was very poor in mathematics, physics and chemistry.Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in east China's Shandong Province. He is the first Chinese national to win the Nobel literature award.On Monday, Mo was appointed director of the International Writing Center of his alma mater, Beijing Normal University. He said he would encourage college students to engage in creating literature on campus.
