Chinese actresses Zhang Ziyi, Fan Bingbing and Zhang Yuqi walked the red carpet as Cannes Film Festival opened Tuesday.The art of the blockbuster took center stage on the opening day of the Cannes Film Festival, with Steven Spielberg presiding over the festival jury and Baz Luhrmann presenting his big-budget "The Great Gatsby."Cloudy skies did little to dim the frenzy of the start of the 12-day French Riviera extravaganza, where dozens of the world's most artistically ambitious films are set to premiere on the festival's global platform. Wednesday, though, was a day for star power.Spielberg has had films at Cannes before, including "E.T." and "Sugarland Express," but never in competition. His presence here is a rarity, and he was received like a visiting head of state, a king of cinema.He's serving as president of a jury that will decide the prestigious Palm d'Or, given to one of the 20 competing films. (Entries include new works from the Coen brothers, Alexander Payne and Steven Soderbergh.) This year's jury is an intimidating, starry bunch, including Nicole Kidman, Ang Lee and Christoph Waltz."Everyone sits in judgment of us," Spielberg said. "So it's our turn."(Agencies)Â
