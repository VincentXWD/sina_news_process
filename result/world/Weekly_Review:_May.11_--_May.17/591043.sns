In a world first, a game of Mahjong was held amid soaring views Wednesday on the summit of the Sydney Harbour Bridge as Australia prepares to host its first ever International Mahjong competition.It was certainly a sight to remember as East meets West on top of one of Australia's most recognizable icons.The intrepid players, Pauline Heng, Tony Liu, Ling Khor and Jak Heng, scaled to the summit of the bridge, 134 meters above sea level, and tested each other's skills in this sport which combines skill, strategy and luck.Mahjong has been moving out of China in recent years to become a globally recognized game.After three competitions held in Macau, the World Series of Mahjong Tournament is moving to Australia next month.This year, players will be competing for a prize pool of 1 million Australian dollars.Pauline Heng, the CEO of Mahjong Australia, said"Sydney is a fantastic place to have this tournament. Mahjong has become a popular cross cultural sport with a large number of local Chinese and Australians playing on a daily and weekly basis."World Series of Mahjong 2013 aims to attract 500 players to compete from Australia and overseas. International players will mostly come from the greater China region but it is expected that up to 15 countries will be represented.Since its inception in 2007, the three annual competitions have all taken place in Macau. The last World Series of Mahjong was held at The Venetian in Macau in 2010. Chan Tak-Kwan from Hong Kong was crowned as the champion.As part of Sydney Bridgeclimb's promotion of its new Mandarin Climb -- which features local Mandarin speaking guides -- players were rewarded with spectacular 360 degree views of the city and one of the most beautiful harbors in the world.Hailing from very different backgrounds, but all sharing a passion for Mahjong, the Chinese tradition is finding its feet in Australia.Ling is a paralegal, Tony is the proprietor of Jade Express Travel and a winner of various Mahjong tournaments, Pauline is a business migration agent and organizer of Mahjong tournaments, while Jak is a postgraduate student.Jak first learned to play Mahjong on a trip down the Yangtze River when he was eight year old. He spent many hours watching the Chinese onboard playing the game. Not speaking Chinese, he had to learn how to play by studying their actions over the three-day cruise. "The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a powerful symbol of Australia. Similarly, Mahjong is an iconic game that originated in China, so it was a rewarding as well as unusual sight to have the two brought together in such exceptional circumstances,"Heng said.The Competition kicks off in Sydney on June 2.Xinhua
