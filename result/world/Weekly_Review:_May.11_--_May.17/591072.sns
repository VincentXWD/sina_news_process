The Miami Heat reached their third straight Eastern Conference final after a 94-91 win over Chicago on Wednesday secured a 4-1 series victory for the defending NBA champions.Miami will face the winners of the series between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers. Indiana currently lead 3-1.The Heat put up 10 unanswered points to start the game and at one stage led by 18 in the first quarter but once again the Bulls fought back.Miami's sharp movement of the ball fell away dramatically, as did their shooting, as Chicago, led by the livewire Nate Robinson and the powerhouse, Carlos Boozer roared back.Chicago led 53-47 at the half and went into the fourth quarter with a 77-69 advantage but Miami got their second wind when it mattered.A three-pointer from Shane Battier and a Chris Anderson dunk helped Miami close the gap before Norris Cole's left-handed dunk put the Heat back in the lead with 6:40 left on the clock.Still the Bulls kept on scrapping and it was not until Jimmy Butler's hopeful three point attempt in the final moments was off-target that Miami could finally celebrate.League MVP LeBron James finished as Miami's top scorer with 23 points with Dwyane Wade providing 18.Boozer ended with 26 points and 14 rebounds as the depleted Bulls, without their star Derrick Rose throughout the season, finally bowed out.(Agencies)
