THE State Council yesterday published a list of 71 items that no longer require central government approval or now only require consent from lower-level authorities.The changes include some which will make it easier for foreign firms to do business in China.For instance, foreign companies can register their permanent representative offices in China with provincial governments instead of the central government and they can apply to provincial governments to do business in China.Also, foreigners will not need a police permit to travel in China in their own vehicles.The State Council statement is intended to lower the benchmark for market entry, deepen investment structure reform, give full play to the market's role in resource distribution and inspire enterprises to use their own power for development, according to spokesmen from three government organs in charge of the removal of administrative approval items.The removal of the obligation of securing central approval is part of efforts to cut government intervention in economic and social affairs.According to the statement, companies that want to invest in civilian airport expansion, subway train production and the development of oil fields with an annual output of 1 million tons or more will no longer need government approval.China will also tighten controls over the number of new administrative approval items, the spokesmen said.More administrative approval items will be cancelled, especially those that have incurred complaints from the public and enterprises and have bearing on enterprises' operating costs and people's livelihoods, the spokesman said.The removed items affect aspects of the economy and society from industry and agriculture to education and entertainment.Â
