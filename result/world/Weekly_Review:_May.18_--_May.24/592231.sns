Jose Mourinho's three-year term as coach of Spanish BBVA Primera Liga club Real Madrid will end on June 30, it was confirmed this Monday.Club President Florentino Perez confirmed the news at a press conference held at 8pm local time in the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium following a meeting of the club's Board of Directors.Despite having a contract with the club until the end of June 2016, Mourinho will abandon the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium after winning just one Copa del Rey (2011), one League title (2012) and the Spanish Supercup at the start of the current campaign.Perez said the club had "reached agreement with Mourinho to finalize our relationship," and then thanked him for his three years in charge and his "dedication to Real Madrid, in which we have taken a leap forward in sporting terms."The announcement comes just three days after Real Madrid were beaten 2-1 in by local rivals Atletico Madrid in the final of the Spanish Copa del Rey, which was held in Bernabeu on Friday night. It was the first time Atletico have defeated Real Madrid in 14 years and many blamed Mourinho's team selection on the defeat.Mourinho continued with Diego Lopez in goal ahead of Spain and Madrid captain, Iker Casillas, while Raul Albiol played in central defense ahead of Pepe, who was has not played since publically saying Casillas deserved respect.Mourinho was also sent off in the game, and along with Cristiano Ronaldo, who was also sent off, is thought to have upset his club President by his decision not to accept his runners-up medal from King Juan Carlos of Spain.These are the latest in a series of controversies which have blighted Mourinho's time at Real Madrid, among which were his aggression against current FC Barcelona coach, Tito Vilanova in the final of the 2012 Supercup.Mourinho walked up behind Vilanova, who at that time was assistant coach and stuck his finger in his eye, for which he was given a four game ban.The coach also had incidents, such as confronting referee, Teixeira Vitienes in the car park of the Camp Nou Stadium after his side had been knocked out of the 2012 Spanish Cup by Barcelona, or his decision to challenge the crowd to boo him ahead of the league game at home to Atletico Madrid earlier this season.Meanwhile he has had a difficult relationship with referees in Spain, publically criticizing them on occasions over decisions which have gone against his side.However, the determining factor has been his deteriorating relationship with Casillas, who has not played since recovering from a broken finger he suffered in late January. Mourinho preferred Diego Lopez, who was signed from Sevilla to cover for the Spain international and recently said Casillas would not be first choice again while he was at the club.Most put this decision down to the bad relationship between the pair, although Casillas' journalist girlfriend, Sara Carbonero certainly did not help matters when she announced on Mexican TV there was a bad relationship in the club dressing room.As well as losing to Atletico in the Spanish Cup, Real Madrid lost in the semi-finals of the Champions League to Borussia Dortmund and are 11 points behind FC Barcelona in the Primera Liga with just two game left to play.Speaking after the Cup defeat on Friday, Mourinho said that although many clubs would be pleased with these achievements, it was the worst season he has had as a club coach.Although he will now stand for re-election as club president in elections which he confirmed will be held on July 16, Florentino Perez must take some of the blame for Mourinho's failure at Real Madrid. Perez allowed Mourinho increasing powers over Mourinho's spell, dispensing with the services of director of sport, Jorge Valdano, who has influence over signings, doing nothing to curb Mourinho's more controversial moments and allowing such a bad atmosphere to build up around the club.Since sacking the current Spain coach, Vicente del Bosque at the end of the 2002-3 season, Real Madrid have won just four trophies in seven seasons with Perez as President (Ramon Calderon was club President from 2007-2009) - Two Spanish Supercups, one Spanish Cup and one league title. Meanwhile the club has invested over 500 million Euros in signing players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, David Beckham, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, and etc.Mourinho will now almost certainly return to Barclays Premier League club, Chelsea, where he enjoyed considerable success, winning two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups between June 2004 and September 2007.Paris Saint Germain coach, Carlo Ancelotti looks likely to replace Mourinho after it was confirmed he has asked to leave the French club. However, Paris want Ancelotti to see out the remaining year on his contract and Madrid may have to pay compensation in order to bring the experienced Italian coach to Spain.
