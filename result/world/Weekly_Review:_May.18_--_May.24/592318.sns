BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhuanet) -- A new study shows that Vitamin D could act as a possible new treatment for asthma, as it has the potential to significantly reduce the symptoms of the condition, according to media reports Tuesday.Researchers at King's College London found that vitamin helps asthma sufferers because it works to soothe an overactive part of the immune system in asthma.However, researchers noted that steroids, which are currently used to treat asthma, do not work for all asthma sufferers.Researchers noted that many people with asthma have a steroid resistant variation of the condition, and steroid tablets can have harmful side effects."These findings are very exciting as they show that Vitamin D could one day be used not only to treat people with steroid resistant asthma but also to reduce the doses of steroids in other asthma patients, reducing the risk of harmful side effects," Professor Catherine Hawrylowicz from the King's MRC & Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, lead author of the study, said.(Agencies)
