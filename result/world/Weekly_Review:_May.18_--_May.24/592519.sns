Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on Monday called for efforts from member states to ensure that health occupies a high place on the post-2015 development agenda.Addressing the 66th World Health Assembly, Chan said health was a measurable indicator of the success of all other development policies and should be one of the priority areas for members in making post-2015development plans.She said public health looked more and more like a harbor of hope that allowed and inspired all countries to work together for the good of humanity, at a time when the world is deeply troubled with problems such as food shortages, climate change, as well as armed conflicts and other political and economic woes.The WHO chief also expressed gratitude for China's efforts on collecting and communicating information on the new coronavirus and H7N9 avian influenza virus, and for collaborating closely with the WHO.Nearly 3,000 delegates from WHO's 194 member states came to Geneva for the annual meeting that was opened Monday. Topics to be discussed during the eight-day session include WHO reform, health in the post-2015 development agenda, and universal health coverage.
