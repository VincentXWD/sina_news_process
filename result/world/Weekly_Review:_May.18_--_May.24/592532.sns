The Philippines has protested the “illegal” presence of a Chinese warship, two surveillance vessels and fishing boats off a shoal in Nansha Islands, the South China Sea, in the latest territorial squabble between the Asian countries, Philippine officials said Tuesday.Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said the Philippines denounced the "provocative and illegal presence" of Beijing's ships off Ayungin Shoal (China’s Ren’ai Reef) in the South China Sea, adding the area is "an integral part of our national territory."Chinese diplomats did not immediately react to the protest, which Hernandez said was filed two weeks ago at the Chinese Embassy in Manila.Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said another protest might be lodged if authorities confirm that two ships which “chased a Philippine official's ferry boat” last week were Chinese government vessels.Ren’ai Reef is currently under the jurisdiction of Sansha city, which was created last year for the administration of islands in the South China Sea. In May, 1999, after a Philippine landing ship ran aground in the north-west tip of Ren’ai Reef due to a leak problem, Manila deployed troops to the reef, which has been under its de facto control since. (Agencies)
