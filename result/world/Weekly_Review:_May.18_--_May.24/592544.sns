In 1941, Japanese men threatened 14-year-old Kim Bok-dong at her home in Korea and sent her off to frontline areas in China, Indonesia and Malaysia to serve as a "comfort woman," providing sex to Japanese soldiers.Now 87, Kim, from South Korea, spoke at a rally called "Peace Action 2013," where she challenged the recent controversial remarks uttered by Japan Restoration Party co-leader Toru Hashimoto, who said that comfort women were a necessary part of the war.“Could he send his own daughter as a comfort woman if it was so necessary?” Kim said to the crowd of about 3,500 people. “The past cannot be changed by false claims. I want young people to learn the truth.”Kim added that she decided to speak out because she does not want to see any more women victimized.People at the meeting said they took Hashimoto’s remarks as contempt for Okinawans, with some shouting, “We don’t forgive remarks that ridicule Okinawans.”Hiroji Yamashiro, director of the administrative office of Okinawa Peace Action Center that hosted the meeting, asked why Hashimoto's electorates have allowed the Osaka mayor to remain in office even after making such outrageous remarks.“We are also concerned about such public sentiments,” the 60-year-old said.Elsewhere on May 19, Kil Won-ok gave a speech in Hiroshima about her experiences of being forced to work in a brothel in Manchuria during the war when she was 11 years old.“I feel regret and it hurts,” the 84-year-old South Korean told the crowd of more than 220 people attending the event. “I always feel sadness in my heart.”Kil, who is now in poor health, can’t move about without the use of a wheelchair and the assistance of people.She told the crowd that she is concerned about the current situation in Japan, where politicians have repeatedly made hurtful remarks about the former comfort women.She added that Japan could create victims like herself again unless it seeks a path of peace.Hiroyuki Kubo, who lives in Hiroshima's Kure, attended the event.“I’m afraid we can't tell the world of the tragedy of the atomic bombing if we don’t face up to what we have done and reflect on it,” said the 81-year-old atomic bomb survivor.(Agencies)
