Chinese giants Guangzhou Evergrande marched into the AFC Champions League quarterfinals and underlined their strong title credentials with a convincing 3-0 win over Central Coast Mariners on Wednesday.Goals from Muriqui, Dario Conca and Gao Lin took Marcello Lippi's team through with room to spare, as Japan's Kashiwa Reysol also swept into the last eight with a 5-2 aggregate win over Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors.Guangzhou, 2-1 winners in last week's first leg, are now into the quarters for the second straight year as they target China's first Asian title since 1990. And they will remain one of the favorites after another impressive performance.The hosts had to wait only 7 minutes to open their account, when Gao's instinctive flick released Muriqui in the box and the prolific Brazilian rolled it past Mariners goalkeeper Mat Ryan for his eighth goal of the tournament.Argentinian maestro Conca was causing havoc and after teasing the Mariners defense on the edge of the area, his pullback to Muriqui drew a clumsy challenge from Bernie Ibini-Isei and a penalty.Conca stepped up for the spot kick, on the stroke of halftime, and his left-footed strike curled low and to the goalkeeper's right to make it 2-0 and effectively kill off the Mariners' hopes.With celebrations already under way among the large and boisterous Tianhe Stadium crowd, Ryan denied Muriqui and Gao early in the second half.And Gao's efforts paid off on 68 minutes when he was set up by Conca for Guangzhou's well-taken third, despite the Mariners' protests that the Chinese forward had strayed offside.Chances were at a premium for the visitors but substitute Oliver Bozanic blazed over and defender Feng Xiao-ting had to clear another effort off the line. And in the dying seconds, Daniel McBreen's header was flagged off for offside.Earlier Kashiwa, with a 2-0 advantage from the first leg, came back from a goal down to win 3-2 in the return game and eliminate 2006 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors.The result maintains Japanese interest in the competition and with the loss of Jeonbuk, the only former winners still standing, it ensures the 10th different champion in 11 editions of the Asian tournament.Kashiwa had their hearts in their mouths when defender Tatsuya Masushima put the ball in his own net on 22 minutes. But Hirofumi Watanabe connected with an inviting Jorge Wagner cross to restore parity just before halftime. Wagner was on target 6 minutes after the break, and Kashiwa were all but there when Masato Kudo fired in a low shot to make it 3-1 on 69 minutes.Kevin Oris grabbed a late consolation for the visitors.(Agencies)
