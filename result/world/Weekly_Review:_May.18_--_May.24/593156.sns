Chinese newspaper slams Biden's commencement speech

In a comment piece published today, Chinese newspaper Global Times criticized Biden's Penn commencement address, in which he said Chinese people can not think different, breathe freely. Here is the article:American Vice President Joe Biden's commencement speech at the University of Pennsylvania on May 13 irked more than 340 Chinese students, prompting them to pen a joint letter asking for an apology for his inappropriate remarks.In the speech, Biden said that China is a nation where people cannot "breathe freely," or "think alternatively."Biden has a record for making wild, off-the-cuff remarks. He has repeatedly been criticized for them, such as when he said Russia is a "declining nation" in an interview.Biden's off-the-cuff remarks are no mere personal hobby. Some American politicians are also members of this "outspoken" club. It's a pity, and ironic, that the superpower which flaunts openness and equality is so addicted to judging others based on its own standards and values. Big brother seems to have left an impression as a control freak.The bigger problem is that Biden chose the wrong place to spout his personal ideas. His prejudiced remarks are like a square peg in a round hole when it comes to truth-seeking and avoiding bias at university.A Chinese student recalled Biden's speech and said that he was given rounds of applause during the speech but when he started to say "the Chinese are going to eat our lunch," all of Franklin Field, university's stadium, fell silent.Wise political figures try to avoid uttering politically charged remarks in non-political circumstances, especially at a commencement ceremony for tens of thousands of students who come from different ethnic backgrounds.Among all the Ivy League schools, the University of Pennsylvania probably has one of the largest Chinese student communities.It was therefore no surprise that those Chinese students, who had been expecting a happy ending to their university life, were frustrated by a sour note that belittled their home country as an illiberal and uncreative nation.The US, nicknamed a melting pot, has always been regarded as one of the most inclusive societies. The power of respecting and integrating different cultures should not only be applied to its internal affairs, but can also be used as a principle to guide its external moves.The US is not an exceptional country whose power can be abused to boss around the rest of the world. This arrogance has blinded its eyes, and it is time for the superpower to be more open-minded, and accept the reality that the world is so diverse that the US is supposed to treat it with respect and equality.
