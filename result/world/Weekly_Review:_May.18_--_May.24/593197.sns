The world has responded with outrage over Osaka Mayor Toru Hashmimoto’s comments on sex slaves exploited by the Japanese army during world War II. Joining the chorus now is one Japanese who served as a medical orderly in China during the war. He recounts his experience and talks about the injusticies faced by those used as "comfort women" during the war.Masayoshi Matsumoto joined the Japanese army in 1943. He believed he was fighting a righteous war to free Asia from the yoke of Western imperialism.But many years later, it is a very different story."I feel like a war criminal - it’s painful to talk about the things I saw, I’d rather cover it all up," Japanese Veteran Masayoshi Matsumoto said.Guilt-ridden, the 91-year-old cannot help himself."But at the same time, I feel I’ve got to speak out. However hard, I believe talking about these things is my purpose in life now. The reason I’ve been allowed to live so long," Japanese Veteran Masayoshi Matsumoto said.Matsumoto was stationed in Yu County in China’s Shanxi Province. He helped examine six or seven women for venereal disease after they were brought there to provide sexual services for about 300 soldiers."They had to go for sexual health checks. It was their job to do it -- just as it was my job to check them. There was no choice in the matter. To refuse would have been a death sentence," Japanese Veteran Masayoshi Matsumoto said.These women had no means of escape. And according to Matsumoto, they were in fact sex slaves.These women are only part of a total of 200,000 so-called "comfort women". Some scholars estimate the number to be as high as 410,000. For many countries, the scars run deep.But the repeated irresponsible statements by Japanese leaders have brought back bitter memories for many countries that suffered Japan’s military occupation."The Prime Minister should apologize fully and without reservation on behalf of the Japanese nation," Japanese Veteran Masayoshi Matsumoto said.An apology that would go some distance in healing old wounds. However, many would argue, it will never be enough.(Agencies)
