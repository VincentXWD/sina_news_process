By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishA 13-year-old girl, in handcuffs, was paraded through the streets for 20 minutes after she accidentally poured coke cola into a car belonging to the government of Kele township, Hezhang county in SW Guizhou, according to an anonymous online posting, sparking outcry among Chinese netizens.The young girl's aunt was beaten up by more than 30 police officers after she protested at "handcuffing the lttle girl" named Rao Yao. Rao later was illegally detained for 12 hours in a police station.Yuan Zehong, the party secretary of the township, told reporters in an interview later that it happened after some local law enforcement officials got involved in a dispute with the girl's parents, both street vendors.Yuan said the alleged "public shaming" report was false and they were just taking her to the police car, not aware she is underage since she is such a "big" girl.Local residents said during Yuan's rule, there have been numerous clashes between law enforcement officials and farmers, street vendors. Illegal land confiscation is also a serious problem here.A petition calling for investigation of Yuan has gathered over a thousand signatures.China's state television CCTV said Tuesday in a microblog that Yuan and a policeman named Chen Song have beenÂ suspended from duty pending investigation into their conduct.In 2010, China ended the public shaming of "criminal suspects" by parading them through the streets after online activists launched a campaign to ban this practice, which was most often used in periodic government crackdowns on prostitution.
