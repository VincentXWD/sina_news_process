Following Apple's recent profit drop, it looks as if Foxconn may start to produce its own accessories range. According to sources within the company speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Foxconn is now looking to gain new clients and reduce reliance on Apple.Foxconn saw a 19 per cent revenue fall in Q1 2013, which fell in line with Apple's first profit drop year on year in a decade. Foxconn plans to start providing both the parts and labour for technology, rather than just assembly.The really exciting news is that Foxconn is planning to sell its own branded accessories to match up with Apple products. Built in house, they could consist of headphones for the iPhone, or a case for the iPad. It is even possible Foxconn will start selling electronics it produces directly.Related: Foxconn labour union election described as revamp 2013-02-05 23:46:56  Foxconn expands to branded television business 2013-01-25 11:08:48  Foxconn workers in Beijing strike over pay and bonuses 2013-01-25 08:46:49  Foxconn employees confirmed as bus accident casualties 2013-01-17 21:55:29  Probe into allegations of bribes at Foxconn 2013-01-11 07:23:01 Apple has had a fairly quiet year so far in 2013, releasing no new products. Expect something to be unveiled, be it software or hardware, at WWDC on 10 June. The company's CEO Tim Cook has promised new products will be coming from Apple in Autumn this year, so Apple will likely be ramping up production around now.Either way, Foxconn is clearly keen to reduce the dependance it has on Apple for profit and production. On top of this, the manufacturer is obviously looking for a way to manufacturer its own products at a profit.(Agencies)
