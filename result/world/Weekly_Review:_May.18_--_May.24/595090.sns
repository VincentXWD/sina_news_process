Dalian'S mounted policewomen unit is drawing fire for earning illegal profits and costing the city too much money for being nothing more than a "tourist attraction," China Business News reported.The city in Liaoning Province opened the division's training facility to visitors in 2001 after it became widely known that tourists were keen to be photographed with the policewomen on horseback.The facility charges 50 yuan (US$8.20) per person, according to the report. The ticket includes equestrian performances while visitors can pay additional fees to ride a horse, the report added.China Business News estimated the training facility has earned at least 30 million yuan in 12 years from ticket sales, which it said was a violation of regulations that bans police from being engaged in activities for profit.The report said it is not known how this money is spent. It added the unit is funded by the local public security bureau. China Business News said the bureau allocates 3 million yuan annually to take care of the unit's horses, plus additional funds to pay the 65 policewomen in the unit.The Dalian government spent 5 million yuan to build the training facility in 1999 and Hong Kong Jockey Club donated 100 retired racehorses, the report said.Lu Yun, a Beijing lawyer, was cited as saying a tax stamp can't be found on the tickets, implying that they were printed without authorization.Once dubbed part of the Dalian landscape, mounted policewomen are attracting more public criticism after Zhao Ming, a retired cop, described them as a decoration.Public security authorities lack funds and policemen while the government continues to spend large amounts of taxpayers' money on horses, Zhao added.He suggested authorities disband the division because they could serve the city better if they worked under the tourism bureau.
