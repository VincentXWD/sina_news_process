The Japanese government on Monday responded to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's comment, mentioned in a speech in Germany, that Japan had stolen islands in the East China Sea.Premier Li Keqing, who is in Potsdam of Germany in his first overseas trip as premier, stressed that the Potsdam agreement reaffirmed Japan should return all territory stolen from China. Specifically, he said: "Japan must return the islands they have stolen, including the islands in northeastern China and Taiwan."Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga countered the view. He was quoted by Kyodo News Agency as saying Monday afternoon that "That remark ignores history. (Japan) can never accept it," in the latest flare-up of the bilateral dispute over Diaoyu Islands."The Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands are part of Japan's inherent territory in terms of history and international laws," the top government spokesman said, adding any of such remarks by China will not affect the Japanese standpoint.(Agencies)
