BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) announced Monday that it will levy provisional anti-dumping duties on pyridine imported from India and Japan.After a preliminary investigation that started in September last year, the MOC determined that Indian producers had sold pyridine in China at dumping margins ranging from 24.6 percent to 57.4 percent, and Japanese producers sold the product at a 47.9-percent dumping margin.Starting Tuesday, Chinese entities importing pyridine from the two countries will be required to pay deposits with Chinese customs calculated according to the dumping margins, the MOC said in a statement posted on its website.Pyridine is an organic compound used as an important raw material and solvent in the production of pesticides, drugs, animal feed, food additives and other chemicals.
