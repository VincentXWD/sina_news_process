Bangkok will welcome more than 12.2 million visitors in 2012, with visitor cross-border spending of US$19.3 billion, which represents a growth rate of 16.6%.This is the second installment of the MasterCard research, which is used as a barometer for understanding the global economy and the dynamic flow of commerce across the world. The MasterCard Index of Global Destination Cities ranks cities in terms of the number of their total international visitor arrivals and the cross-border spending by these same visitors in the destination cities, and gives visitor and passenger growth forecasts for 2012. This Index and the accompanying reports are not based on MasterCard volumes or transactional data.The Index projects sustained growth among emerging market cities with the top ten Asia/Pacific destinations expecting a 9.5% growth in visitor arrivals for 2012 and a 15.3percent surge in cross-border spending. In the Index's top ten global cities, Bangkok ranks 3rd place, with a 6.5% growth in visitor arrivals for 2012 and a 16.6% growth in cross border spending, followed by Singapore (4th), Hong Kong (6th) and Kuala Lumpur (10th). Bangkok is the number one destination city in Asia/Pacific, both in terms of number of visitor arrivals and cross-border spending, reflecting its strong and abiding appeal to tourists from the rest of the world.

Singapore was in fourth rank with 11.8 million visitors, with Hong Kong sixth with 11.1 million visitors, and Kuala Lumpur ranked 10th with 8.1 million visitors expected.The region also ranked highly on visitor spending with Bangkok ranked third globally with US$19.3 billion expected to be spent by inbound passengers in 2012, a 16.6% jump from last year. Singapore leapt two places to fifth overall with US$12.7 billion, up 12.7% on last year. Seoul moved into the top ten with US$10.6 billion in cross-border spend, an increase of 16.2%, while Tokyo, still recovering from the triple disasters of 2011 moved up four places to 14th, is officially the world's third-fastest growing market (24.2%) in terms of cross-border spending.In terms of growth in visitor numbers six out of the top 20 fastest growing cities in the Index were from Asia/Pacific with Tokyo second globally behind Rio de Janeiro (28.6%) with a 21.5% growth in visitor arrivals. Taipei and Beijing also featured in both the top ten growth cities by visitor arrivals and cross-border spending."Asia's destination cities continue their rise, expecting a significant upward trend in visitor arrivals and cross-border spendâ€”most of them on the back of large double digit growth," observed Dr. Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, global economic advisor, MasterCard Worldwide.London once again topped the world's cities by visitor numbers with 16.9 million inbound passengers expected in 2012, ahead of Paris in second place with 16 million inbound passengers expected.London also ranked first on cross-border expenditure, ahead of New York in second place, with estimated expenditures in these cities for 2012 amounting to US$21.1 billion and US$19.4 billion respectively.While cities in Europe and the US still ranked highly in the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dr. Hedrick-Wong said that the number of emerging market cities featuring in the Index showed Asia's growing role in the global economy."The leading Asian cities are some of the most sought after destinations for visitors from all over the world, and the Index indicates that they will continue to thrive into 2012," he said."Another interesting trend that we observe is a rise in cashless payments with many international travelers opting to do electronic transactions rather than using cash. The trend is a response to an increasing demand for safe, simple and smart payments, and highlights the rising importance of cashless commerce for both business and leisure travel," Dr. Hedrick-Wong concluded.Agencies
