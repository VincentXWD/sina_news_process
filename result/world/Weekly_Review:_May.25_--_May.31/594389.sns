China’s most prominent director Zhang Yimou was named artistic director of Le Vision Pictures at a gala event in Beijing on Monday. He will also oversee a new in-house production fund.“Signing with Le Vision Pictures symbolizes the end of my long period of irregular and disordered cooperation, and the start of a new cooperation with a professional team,” Zhang told a press conference at the Park Hyatt in Beijing.This is Zhang's first public appearance since rumor spread earlier this month that he fathered 7 children with 4 women.News that Zhang is joining Le Vision officially brings to an end Zhang’s relationship with his longtime collaborator and producer Zhang Weiping, after the two parted ways amid differences over the Christian Bale-starrer “The Flowers of War,” which did less than stellar B.O. in China.Under the arrangement, Le Vision Pictures will have what executives called a “long-term, exclusive deal” with Mr. Zhang to create movies for theaters and the Internet. Mr. Zhang, who directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, is known for creating critical favorites like “Red Sorghum” and “Raise the Red Lantern” as well as spectacles like the martial arts film “Hero.”You may also be interested in:Zhang Yimou: "Where did my seven children come from?" 2013-05-27 14:20:11  Wuxi refuses to confirm registration of Zhang Yimou's kids 2013-05-13 14:43:10  Pictures of Zhang Yimou and his second wife 2013-05-09 17:23:14  China probes reports of Zhang Yimou's seven children 2013-05-09 13:03:36  Director Zhang Yimou has seven children by 4 women 2013-05-07 15:00:31 Further details of the agreement were not made public. Zhang Zhao, the chief executive of Le Vision Pictures (and no relation to the director), said only that the deal came together “within the span of a few weeks” and that Zhang Yimou’s financial compensation was in recognition of the reality that “he, like anyone else, has to buy a house and get married.”Agencies
