Firefighters have rescued a newborn boy from a sewer pipe below a squat toilet, sawing out an L-shaped section and then delicately dismantling it to free the cocooned baby, who greeted the rescuers with cries.A tenant heard the baby's sounds in the public restroom of a residential building in Zhejiang Province in eastern China on Saturday and notified authorities.Video of the two-hour rescue of Baby No. 59, so named because of his incubator number in the hospital in Pujiang County of the city of Jinhua, was shown on Chinese news programs and websites yesterday.The baby, who weighed 2.8 kilograms, had a low heart rate and some minor abrasions on his head and limbs, but was mostly unhurt, according to Zhejiang Online, the province's official news site. The placenta was still attached.It was unclear how the baby ended up in the toilet, but police said they were treating the case as an attempted homicide. The Pujiang County police bureau said on its official microblog account that the boy's mother has been located and that an investigation was under way.In the video, officials were shown removing the pipe from a ceiling that apparently was just below the restroom and then, at the hospital, using pliers and saws to gently pull apart the pipe, which was about 10 centimeters in diameter.News of the baby's ordeal was met with horror and pity by bloggers on Chinese sites. Most speculated that the child had been dumped by his parents down the toilet.
