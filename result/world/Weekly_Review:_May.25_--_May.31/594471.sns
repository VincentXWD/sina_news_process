By Jia Xiaoguang, Sina EnglishTwo men broke into the dormitory building in a middle school in Fuzhen County, C China's Hebei Province and raped six female students on May 22 night,  according to a report by Beijing News on Wednesday.An unnamed local villager told the newspaper that the victims' families had not been informed until three days after the rape case."Those girls just locked themselves up indoors and remained mute since then." he said.One family member of one of the six students confirmed during a telephone interview yesterday that the girl currently still stays at home."She refuses to eat or drink anything, and will burst into tears once we try to talk to her. "The dormitory is built in a bungalow that belongs to the No.1 middle school of Fuzhen County. With two local farmers guarding the only gate, the school also built a residential building for the teaching faculty and their families in its campus, according to some local villagers.Since teachers are permitted to sell their properties to buyers outside the school, the influx and efflux of a mixed bag of people are virtually unchecked, they said.Some official of the local public security bureau confirmed the existence of the case, saying that the two suspects, one of whom still under 18, have been detained by the police.A special team has been set up by the local government to conduct further investigation of the case.
