Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin assured Chinese Ambassador Ma Keqing on Wednesday that the Philippines is sending ships to the reef only to deliver supplies to its soldiers, and it has no plans to build infrastructure on the reef.China raised the issue during an informal talk between Chinese Ambassador Ma Keqing and Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin at Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City yesterday.“They were concerned that the Philippines is coming up with structures, additional structures in the Ren’ai Reef,” the defense chief told reporters.“I told her that the ship that is moving toward Ren’ai Reef is only for provisions of food and water for soldiers who are there,” he added.In an apparent effort to defuse tensions, the Philippines assured China that it has no plans to build infrastructure on the reef.“The ships are also for the rotation of troops. We cannot place people there permanently. They’ll go insane,” Gazmin said.Ma said that her talk with Gazmin was mainly about friendly relations between China and the Philippines.“We also talked about the balanced relations. I think China is ready to develop cooperation and very good exchanges between the two sides because this year is the year of friendly exchanges between our two countries,” she said.Ren’ai Reef is currently under the jurisdiction of Sansha city, which was created last year for the administration of islands in the South China Sea. In May, 1999, after a Philippine landing ship ran aground in the north-west tip of Ren’ai Reef due to a leak problem, Manila deployed troops to the reef, which has been under its "de facto control" since.(Agencies)
