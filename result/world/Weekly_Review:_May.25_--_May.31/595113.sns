Popular former France defender Eric Abidal is to leave Barcelona when his contract expires at the end of the season."I would have liked to have stayed and played on at Barcelona but the club saw it differently and I have to respect their decision," an emotional Abidal said yesterday as his voice wavered. "I hope to return because it is a very special club for me."The 33-year-old left back, who fought his way back into the squad after having a liver transplant last year, was joined by club president Sandro Rosell and sports director Andoni Zubizarreta who praised him for his bravery in adversity."He has won our hearts because you can never write him off," Rosell said. "He has had the strength to overcome all types of difficulties - he has taught us life lessons we will never forget."We are not saying goodbye, only 'until we meet again'. When he wants to hang up his boots Barca will open their doors for him to come back and be technical director of the youth academy."Abidal joined Barcelona from Lyon in 2007 and during that time it won four La Liga titles, two Champions League crowns in 2009 and 2011 and two Copas del Rey.His spell at the Nou Camp was marked by a couple of lengthy absences after he was diagnosed with a liver tumor.Abidal underwent an operation in March 2011 before making a triumphant return two months later to lift the Champions League trophy after victory over Manchester United in the final at Wembley. He then had a transplant in April 2012 with part of an organ donated by his cousin.(Agencies)
