The documentary crew that accompanied Dennis Rodman to North Korea over the winter says it had no idea it would meet the country's young leader, Kim Jong Un, until he showed up at a basketball game it was filming.The media company VICE arranged the trip and invited Rodman. A 30-minute documentary on the basketball diplomacy will air on June 14 on HBO as the final episode of VICE's first season, and was previewed for some reporters on Wednesday.The North Korean leader loves basketball so much that he invited the crew in. VICE founder Shane Smith wasn't allowed back but VICE's Ryan Duffy accompanied Rodman and three members of the Harlem Globetrotters traveling basketball troupe."We just wanted to make a good documentary," Smith said in an interview. "We didn't do it as a stunt."The North Koreans did not go through the footage shot by the crew, however. Some 36 hours of film was cut down into the half-hour HBO show, and some may surface later as online extras.The tour was taken in the hopes of catching one or two glimpses of the real North Korean people, which the group finally achieved toward the end when the bus stop at a park and they played around with some of the kids, helping them learn to spin a basketball on their finger.Duffy said the group was surprised when Kim arrived to watch what was essentially a pickup basketball game with the Globetrotters and some members of a North Korean youth team. Rodman didn't play; he sat in the stands watching with Kim. After the game, the VICE crew and players were rushed across Pyongyang unexpectedly for a dinner with Kim and other members of the North Korean government.Although Rodman was key to securing the visit and played the most prominent role of any of the visiting Americans, he's only a bit player in VICE's documentary. Smith said Rodman declined to be interviewed about the trip by VICE afterward.Smith said he's open to heading back to North Korea at some point in the future.(Agencies)
