China's Red Cross struggling to win back trust
2013-05-05 03:28:57 GMT
China’s Red Cross Society used to be a major mobilizer of aid and rescue operations in natural disaster sites around the country. But after the April Lushan Earthquake, many people refused to donate through the organization. The charity’s image seems to have been seriously damaged by a series of scandals, and it’s now struggling to win back the trust.For decades, China’s Red Cross volunteers have worked on many frontlines of disaster relief, providing help and hope.But the major role of the organization is played in the office, and largely behind the scenes... the collection of donations.When a strong 7.0-magnitude earthquake shattered China’s Lushan, the Red Cross again began asking for donations.Yet in sharp contrast to the outpouring of aid five years ago after the earthquake in Wenchuan, this time questions have been haunting this government-run charity. The central question: where has our money gone?In 2011, a young woman named Guo Meimei, who claimed to work for the organization, flaunted her luxury goods on social media. It immediately triggered public outrage, which lasts up to today.China’s Red Cross’s deputy chief has tried to show that the organization is still a trustworthy one."This time about 1.4 billion yuan has been collected for donation for the Lushan Earthquake, and over half was collected by China’s Red Cross. Many of the donors are private-owned companies and individuals." Zhao Baige, Executive Vice-President of Red Corss Society of China said.But the online responses to Red Cross’s call of donation shows it is already knee-deep in a credibility crisis.Most people say they would choose to donate to other charities, or not at all."I can’t find any channel I can trust to donate my money. The Red Cross has so many scandals that I don’t believe my money will go to the hand of those in need." Zhu Na, Beijing resident said."I will never ever donate anything to China’s Red Cross. I’d rather go to the disaster zone on my own to donate my money. No matter what the Red Cross does, it won’t fix its image in my heart." Tian Aijin, Beijing resident said.Frustration and distrust. Analysts say China’s Red Cross is now in a do or die situation..."It’s not just the Guo Meimei incident that triggered the fall of China’s Red Cross’s reputation. The problem lies in the system. The Red Cross is currently run by the Chinese government, which means it does not have to answer to outside forces like civil groups. It will take an overhaul of the system to really win back the trust of the people." Wang Zhenyao, Dean of One Foundation Philanthropy Research Institute said.China’s Red Cross Society was established in 1904. The organization’s deputy chief Zhao Baige says the efforts over a century have been destroyed in just three days by Guo Meimei’s incident. But the question is: how could the reputation of such a huge organization be destroyed so easily? And what can it do to restore the public faith. These questions may only be answered by real actions for years, or even decades to come.
