Juventus retained their Serie A title on Sunday after they beat  Palermo 1-0 at home thanks to a second-half penalty from Arturo Vidal.The "Old Lady" needed only one point from this game to snatch their  second straight Scudetto, and their 29th in total, but the Vidal's  penalty-kick in the 59th minute gave them three.The win moves them 14 points clear in the table, beyond the catch of  the nearest challengers Napoli with only three rounds of matches to  spare.They had to play the final seven minutes of the game one man less as  Paul Pogba who was dismissed for spitting at Palermo defender Salvatore.Antonio Conte, head coach of Juventus, thanked his players for their efforts to win in a tough season."We are very happy and satisfied. The credit goes to these  extraordinary lads who went through a tough and tiring season, but were  always on point," he said."I am proud of them, as it was not easy to win this year despite  being favourites, as we knew the Champions League would take a lot of  energy out of us," he said.Mario Balotelli scored a late goal to help AC Milan put one foot in the Champions League with a 1-0 win at home to Torino."It is an important goal, but it will only be truly important if we  manage to keep this gap over the next few rounds," Balotelli said.Milan are now four points clear of fourth-placed Fiorentina in third -  the final Champions League spot - and with three games left, they will  have to go some to let it slip.Miroslav Klose scored five goals as Lazio thrashed Bologna 6-0 at the Stadio Olimpico.The Germany international netted his hat-trick before half-time and  then came out firing again after the break to put Bologna to the sword  in a dominant performance.Hernanes also got onto the scoresheet for the home side with their  second goal of the day, before Klose stole all of the headlines with a  superb display.Udinese's European hopes remain healthy thanks to a convincing 3-1  win over a Sampdoria side who are looking over their shoulder with a  great deal of concern.Marco Parolo and Jonathan Biabiany scored either side of half-time to  boost Parma's hopes of a top-10 finish with a 2-0 win over Atalanta.Genoa moved three points clear of the relegation zone and condemned  Pescara to an immediate return to Serie B thanks to a 4-1 win at the  Stadio Luigi Ferraris.Gonzalo Bergessio scored all three goals as Catania pushed 10-man  Siena a step closer to the relegation trap door with a 3-0 win.
