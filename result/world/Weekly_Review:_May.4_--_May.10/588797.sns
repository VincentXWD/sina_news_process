Beijing police expressed its deep regret for not solving the thallium poisoning case happened in Tsinghua University 19 years ago and extended its sympathy to the victim Zhu Ling and her families on May 8 via its official microlog (@平安北京) on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter with more than 300 million users.Zhu Ling was a sophomore majoring in chemistry at Tsinghua University when she started experiencing stomach pain, hair loss and other inexplicable symptoms in December, 1994.Doctors eventually diagnosed her with poisoning by thallium in April 1995. And the university security department reported the case to the police soon after the diagnosing.“We put the case on file and started investigation. Though we investigated over 130 persons and probed 100 units that sold or used thallium, the police found no direct evidence to identify the criminal suspect as almost half year had passed since the poison case happened,” the microblog said.The police also called on the public to be objective on the case, denying rumors that they were pressured by the suspect's powerful family to halt further investigations.
