British prime minister David Cameron has effectively been barred from visiting China because Beijing is so angry at the British Prime Minister for meeting the Dalai Lama last year, according to Daily Mail.The report says that China wants Mr Cameron to apologize for the meeting, but the British government insists “there is nothing to apologise for”.Under a bilateral agreement, Mr Cameron was due to visit China last autumn but that visit was called off. This year it was the turn of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to visit Britain, but plans for that have been put on hold.But the UK Prime Minister has refused to “bow to pressure from Beijing”, despite warnings that investment in the UK could be put on hold until the crisis is resolved.In strident remarks, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman insisted Britain would not “be bullied by China”, and “We have made clear in advance to the Chinese government that British minister will decide who they meet and where they meet them”, the report quotes.Chinese foreign ministry said the meeting with the Dalai Lama had "seriously interfered with China's internal affairs". Song Tao, China's vice-foreign minister, urged Britain to take "practical actions to correct the error", according to the report.Beijing on Monday insisted Britain must "work with us to bring the relationship back on to a healthy track at an early date", says the report.(Agencies)
