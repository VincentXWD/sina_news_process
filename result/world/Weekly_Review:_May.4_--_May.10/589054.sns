Japan has lodged a diplomatic protest with China over an article in a state-run publication that challenged the ownership of Okinawa, home to major US bases, officials said Thursday.The People's Daily on Wednesday published a call for a review of Japan's sovereignty over Okinawa, suggesting that Beijing may be the rightful owner.The call came as the two countries are already at loggerheads over islands in the East China Sea.According to Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, China told him the article reflects the authors' views only."We have protested both in Tokyo and Beijing over the commentary issued by the People's Daily, followed by a Chinese foreign ministry comment," a Japanese foreign ministry official in charge of Chinese affairs told AFP.(Agencies)
