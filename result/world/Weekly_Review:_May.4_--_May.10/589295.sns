Manchester United have appointed David Moyes to replace Alex Ferguson as the Premier League champion's new manager on Thursday.Man United declared the appointment on website and said Moyes, the current Everton manager, was the the recommendation of Ferguson, which was unanimously approved by the Board.Moyes has committed to a long-term job in six-year deal and will formally take the helm of Old Trafford on July 1, replacing Ferguson, who decided to retire at the end of the season one day ago after 26 years in charge at the Red Devils."When we discussed the candidates that we felt had the right attributes we unanimously agreed on David Moyes," said Ferguson."David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic. I've admired his work for a long time and approached him as far back as 1998 to discuss the position of Assistant Manager here.""He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton. There is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this club."Just about one hour before Man United's announcement, Everton confirmed that Moyes will leave the club at the end of the season."The manager met Chairman Bill Kenwright early yesterday evening (Wednesday 8th May) and confirmed his desire to join Manchester United," the statement said.The 50-year-old Scottish has been the Everton manager since 2002. He succeeded to build his side into a steady strength standing solid in the Premier League, but failed to grab a trophy in 11 years.
