SANAA, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and several others wounded in clashes between Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's forces and the opposition-led armed tribesmen in southern restive province of Taiz on Saturday, medics and witnesses said."Two members from the opposition Islamic Islah (reform) Party were killed and several others injured, one of them was in critical condition, when a mortar shell hit the headquarters of the Islah Party during the clashes on Saturday's pre-dawn," Sadiq al-Shuga'a, head of the protest camp's field hospital in Taiz, told Xinhua.Clashes between the rival forces flared late Friday in al-Hasab neighborhood in downtown Taiz city, witnesses said.Taiz, about 200 km south of the capital Sanaa, is Yemen's most populous province where tens of thousands of protesters have been camping out since late January to call for Saleh's ouster.The escalation came hours after the opposition leaders told visiting UN envoy to Yemen Jamal bin Omar that they will neither resume dialogue nor sign the proposed mechanism, which Saleh has asked for, until he signs the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative first.Saleh has backed out of signing the initiative for three times in the last minutes since the deal was brokered in April.Bin Omar was expected to leave Yemen late on Friday to present his report to the Security Council on the progress of implementing the UN resolution 2014, which was issued on Oct. 21 and called on Saleh to sign the GCC initiative.At least 94 people were killed and hundreds of others injured during clashes with Saleh's forces in Sanaa and Taiz since the issuance of the UN resolution, according to recent statistics by the opposition coalition Joint Meeting Parties.
