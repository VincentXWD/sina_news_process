SANAA, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Saturday warned his opponents that the response would be "harsh and decisive" if the latter continue to attack the Republican Guard forces.Saleh made the warning in a statement during his inspection visit to the 4th Brigade Republican Guards in the suburb of Sanaa."We warned the opposition-led defected army and dissident armed tribesmen against repeating aggressions on the military bases of the Republican Guards in the districts of Arhab, Samaa, Frijah, Bait Dahra, Nihm and Naqeel bin Ghailan (in northern Sanaa province)," the statement, carried by the official Saba news agency, quoted Saleh as telling the loyalist troops."We tell them that's enough ... Our response will be harsh and decisive," Saleh added.Saleh said that he supports the political change, but he is against violence carried out by the defected army and dissident armed tribesmen."Yes, ... we support change against all corrupted political forces and we at the presidential office are ready to make sacrifices for the country, but you (Republican Guards) will stay on even if we step down, because your are the power, you are the safety valve of the homeland," Saleh said.The Yemeni government has been in the grip of a 10-month-long political crisis triggered by mass protests demanding an end to Saleh's 33-year rule.
