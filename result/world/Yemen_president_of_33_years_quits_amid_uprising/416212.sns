ADEN, Yemen, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- At least four pro-government tribesmen were killed and two others were injured Monday evening in a roadside bomb blast in Yemen's southern province of Abyan, a tribal chief said.A roadside bomb was detonated by a remote control near an anti- al-Qaida tribal checkpoint in Modia district, some 139 km northeast of Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan province, killing at least four pro-government tribesmen and injuring two others, the local tribal chief told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.He said the blast, which took place before sunset, also destroyed a number of tribesmen vehicles.The potential target of the attack might be a convoy of a prominent tribal leader who was expected to visit the area, according to the tribal chief.A local resident said that the al-Qaida terrorist group warned the civilians to stay away from tribal and military gatherings which were regarded as targets by terrorists.Attacks on military officials and tribesmen were common during the past few months in the country's southern regions.For more than six months, government troops supported by armed tribesmen have been fighting militants form the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) who were apparently taking advantage of the country's 10-month political turmoil to bolster their military operations and control in the lawless southern and eastern parts of the country.
