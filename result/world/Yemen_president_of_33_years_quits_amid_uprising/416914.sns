UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has told UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that he will get medical treatment in New York immediately after he signed an agreement that would arrange his surrender of political power, Ban told reporters here Wednesday."He told me clearly that he will hand over all power, but I understand the arrangement and agreement is that he will still remain as president," said Ban, who made telephone conversation with the Yemeni leader on Tuesday. "But he told me that he will come to New York to take medical treatment immediately after signing this agreement."Saleh is reportedly to sign the Gulf-brokered power transfer deal in Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh on Wednesday evening.Under the deal, which Saleh backed out on signing three times at the last minute, the president would resign and hand over power to his deputy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in return for immunity from prosecution. Hadi would then form an opposition-led national government and arrange presidential elections in 60 days.During their phone conversations, Ban told Saleh that "the United Nations will spare no efforts, and as the secretary-general of the United Nations, I will do my best to mobilize the necessary resources and support, so that peace and stability and democratic order will be restored in Yemen."
