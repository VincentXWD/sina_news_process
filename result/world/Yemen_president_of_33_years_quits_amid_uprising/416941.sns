WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday applauded the power transfer deal reached between the Yemeni government and the opposition, calling for its swift implementation."This agreement marks a significant step forward for the Yemeni people in their quest for a unified, democratic, secure and prosperous country," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said at a regular news briefing."We urge all parties within Yemen to refrain from violence and to move swiftly to implement the terms of the agreement in good faith and with transparency, including credible presidential elections within 90 days," he said.He said that the U.S., in coordination with its international partners, will continue to closely monitor and support Yemen's political transition.Under the power transfer deal signed by Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the opposition in Saudi Arabia's capital of Riyadh on Wednesday, the president would resign and hand over power to his deputy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in return for immunity from prosecution. Hadi would then form an opposition-led national government and arrange presidential elections in 60 days.Saleh had agreed to sign the deal brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council three times, but backed out at the last minute.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday that Saleh has told him he would travel to New York for medical treatment after signing the power transfer deal.Toner said that his department has not received any formal travel requests from the president.Yemen was plunged into turmoil in late Jan. this year when anti- government protests broke out, calling for an end to Saleh's 33- year rule.
