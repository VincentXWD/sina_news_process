SANAA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the opposition leaders signed a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative and its implementation mechanism in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Wednesday.As Yemen has been rattled by massive protests since the beginning of this year, the six-nation GCC proposed a deal in April to solve the Yemeni crisis.The initiative called for Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to go to Parliament to announce his resignation within 30 days after signing it in return for official immunity from prosecution.It also stipulated that in two weeks from Saleh's signature, a national government from the Yemeni ruling party General People's Congress (GPC) and the opposition coalition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP), each of which accounts for 50 percent, should be formed and led by the opposition. The final term called for preparations for presidential elections in 60 days since forming a new government.Here are the major points of the GCC deal implementation mechanism:First Phase:A national consensus government shall be formed as stipulated in the GCC initiative, consistent with the constitution, within a period that does not exceed 14 days as of the effective date of the GCC initiative. The vice president shall be designated to issue a decree assigning the candidate chosen by the opposition to form a government.Within 14 days of the effective date of the GCC initiative, Hadi shall establish and chair a Ministerial Committee for Defense and Security Affairs to oversee and supervise all operational, procedural, and policy matters related to the country's armed and security forces. No serving member of the armed forces or security agencies may serve on or participate in the work of the committee.Consistent with the requirements of the GCC initiative, the ministerial committee shall be charged with removing military and security tension, to include but not limited to removing all armed elements, barracks, trenches, and check-points from the capital city and other cities in preparation for restructuring and re- engineering the armed and security forces in the second phase.The government shall establish a ministerial committee to conduct dialogues with the youth protesters in the squares, civil society, and other non-governmental organizations to engage them in shaping the future of the political life in the country.Early presidential elections are held on a deadline that does not exceed 90 days from the effective date of the GCC initiative. Vice President Hadi shall be nominated as a consensus presidential candidate.Within 30 days from the effective date of the GCC initiative, the parliament shall issue and approve the guarantees (immunity) law, which ensures the protection of President Saleh and all those who worked with him, be they politicians, military commanders, security men, or civilians while he was in office.Second Phase:The second Phase shall last for two years.The government calls on political parties and forces including the Southern Movement, Houthis, the youth movements, and civil society organizations to a comprehensive National Dialogue conference.The conference shall discuss the nature and form of the political system, and the bases for building a modern state guaranteeing equal citizenship, the rule of law, balanced representation in the government, fair distribution of wealth, and the right of all citizens to practice their legitimate freedoms and rights according to the law and constitution.No less than 90 days prior to the holding of a popular referendum to approve the proposed constitutional amendments, a new electoral law shall be promulgated on the basis of the amended constitution in such a way that permanently sets out for the elections all the conditions and characteristics of democracy, integrity and credibility pursuant to international standards.The second phase ends by the electing of the new parliament and president of the republic.
