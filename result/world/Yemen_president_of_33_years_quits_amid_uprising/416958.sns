BRUSSELS, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign policy chief on Wednesday welcomed the signing of a political transition agreement in Yemen."I welcome the signature in Riyadh today of the agreement for political transition in Yemen, signed by President (Ali Abdullah) Saleh himself and key representatives of Yemen's ruling and opposition parties," Catherine Ashton said in a statement."The agreement is only the beginning, but it is a very important beginning," she said, "I commend the tireless efforts of all those who have worked for this outcome, in particular the Gulf Cooperation Council.""It is time for all sections of Yemeni society to set aside their differences and make every effort to meet the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people," she said.Ashton said the EU, together with its international partners, would continue to help and support the Yemeni people in their efforts to build a more democratic and prosperous future.Saleh signed the Gulf-brokered power transfer deal in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh earlier on Wednesday. His country was plunged into turmoil when anti-government protests broke out in late January calling for the end of Saleh's 33-year rule.
