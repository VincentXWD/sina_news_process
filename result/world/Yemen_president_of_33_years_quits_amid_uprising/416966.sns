OTTAWA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said here on Wednesday that Canada welcomes the power transfer deal signed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen.Baird said that Saleh's agreement to step down from power in 30 days prepares the way for Yemen's transition to a more open society."We commend all involved, particularly the Gulf Cooperation Council, in negotiating this agreement," Baird said. "We are looking to the President and the interim leadership to respect this agreement," which calls for free, fair and transparent elections to be held in the next 90 days.Baird promised that Canada stands with the people of Yemen in their quest for a brighter future.Saleh signed the power transfer deal in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh on Wednesday after backing out of doing so for at least three times.Under the deal, the president would hand over power to his deputy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and resign within 30 days in return for immunity from prosecution.
