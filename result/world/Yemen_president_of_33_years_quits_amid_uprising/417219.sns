SANAA, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- At least five protesters were killed and 25 others injured on Thursday in Yemeni capital Sanaa when forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh intercepted the anti- government marches calling for prosecuting the president by opening fire, medics and witnesses said.The protesters marched in the Zubairy street in central Sanaa and clashed with Saleh's loyalists a day after the embattled president signed a Gulf-brokered power transfer deal in Riyadh which ensured him immunity from prosecution.The forces then opened fire to put down the marching, Mohamed al-Qubati, a doctor in a field hospital at the anti-government sin- in square, told Xinhua."Death toll increased to five and other 25 protesters were injured when Saleh's gunmen intercepted the march in Zubairy Street," he added.Several witnesses who were at the scene claimed that "the gunmen were members of the ruling party."A protester said they confronted the armed by throwing stones, while a soldier stationing around the Zubairy Street told Xinhua that "the firing took place when the protesters shouted slogans against Saleh, including calls for prosecuting him."Meanwhile, protesters at the Change Square said "there is big conflict between them and leaders of the opposition coalition after the latter agreed with Saleh and signed the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) deal that granted immunity of the president."Under the GCC deal, which Saleh had previously backed away three times at the last minute from signing it, the president would resign and hand over power to his deputy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in return for immunity from prosecution.Yemen has been rattled by 10-month-old unrest triggered by protests demanding an end to Saleh's 33-year rule.
